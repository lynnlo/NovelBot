When Nothing But the Truth was first published, I had trouble getting a reaction from the people it was written
for: kids. Teachers were taking the book and passing it around among themselves, insisting that their principals,
assistant principals, and superintendents read it.
Moreover, wherever I traveled, teachers would take me aside and say something like, “I know this book is
about what happened in my school. Who was it who told you about what happened?”
A principal once asked me if someone sent me his memos.
A teacher from a school named Harrison High handed me a sheet of school stationery. The school’s logo was
the lamp of learning that appears in the book.
It got so that when I spoke to groups of teachers about the book, I took to asking, “Has anyone NOT heard of
such an incident happening in your schools?”
No one ever raised a hand.
It appears that the incident in the book—perhaps not so extreme—is rather common in schools across the
country. And yet, these kinds of things remain somewhat secret—from the kids who go to the school.
How did I—someone who has never taught in a school—come to know about this kind of thing?
First of all, our nation’s schools are wonderfully open, in the democratic sense of the word. If anything in our
nation is of the people, and for the people, it is our schools. Anyone who is an engaged parent knows a great deal
about schools. There is very little one can’t learn about them by looking, asking, and watching—all to our credit.
But there is another way I’ve learned about schools. As a writer of books for young people, I’ve been visiting
schools for more than thirty years. When I am in schools I’ll visit any number of classes. Even so, there are times
when I’m off duty.
Where am I sent between classes? To the “teachers’ lounge.” The lounge is one of the few schoolrooms that is
truly off-limits for most students. It’s here that teachers find time for a moment of relaxation, a flash of quiet, or an
exchange with another teacher about what might be going on in the building that day.
And there I sit, listening to it all.
It’s wonderful how much you can learn by just being quiet and listening. Sometimes you even learn the truth—or
what seems to be the truth.

Two Questions
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth?
Does anyone say no?

From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Coach Jamison saw me in the hall and said he wanted to make sure I’m trying out for the track team!!!! Said my
middle school gym teacher told him I was really good!!!! Then he said that with me on the Harrison High team we
have a real shot at being county champs. Fantastic!!!!!! He wouldn’t say that unless he meant it. Have to ask folks
about helping me get new shoes. Newspaper route won’t do it all. But Dad was so excited when I told him what
Coach said that I’m sure he’ll help.
Saw a thing on TV about Olympic committees already organizing all over the country. Olympics. I’m going to
be there! County champs. State champs. College champs. Then Olympics! Folks always reminding me about the
money they’re putting aside for my college, which is the only way to go. That’s what did Dad in, dropping out.
Too hard to get noticed with just clubs.
Rainy and cold. I hate this kind of weather. Slows you down. Still ran six miles. I’m getting stronger.
Oh, yeah…. At lunch Sarah Gloss came up and said she had to speak to me. Said this girl, Allison Doresett,
likes me. I had to act cool because I wasn’t sure who she was. Then I remembered she’s in my English class and is
really decent. She must have liked that gag question I asked. The two of us would be front-of-the-line. Bet she
heard about my running too. Girls go for guys who win. Ta-da! It’s Malloy Magic time!
Talk about Malloy Magic…. This time for—da-dum!—Miss Narwin. I mean, what can you do with an English
teacher who’s so uptight she must have been put together with super glue. Try to make a joke—lighten things up a
bit—she goes all flinty-faced. Shift to sweet, she goes sour. I mean, people can’t have their own minds about
anything!!! Talk about a free country!!! And the stuff we have to read! Can’t believe how stupid and boring Jack
London is! I mean, really. The Call of the Wild. Talk about dogs! Ma says she had to read it when she was in
school. There has to be better stuff to read for ninth grade somewhere. I thought high school was going to be
different.
Have to figure a way to run past Narwin.
10:45 P.M.
From a Letter Written by Margaret Narwin to Her Sister, Anita Wigham
Yes, Anita, I suppose that after doing anything for twenty-one years a body does get a little tired. And I have been
teaching English at Harrison High for just that long. All the same, I remain steadfast in my belief that my life was
meant to be the bringing of fine literature to young minds. When the connection is made—and from time to time
it is made—it’s all worth it. Is it wrong to speak of the work as a calling? Well, teaching is almost a religion to
me. I will complain from time to time, but—it is my life. The truth is, I like it.
But the other truth, Anita, is that students today are not what they used to be. There is no love of literature. Not
the way you and I learned it from Mother. Young people don’t read at all today—outside of school requirements.
They come to literature reluctantly at best, fighting me every inch of the way. It’s not as if they aren’t bright. They
are. And I like them and their capacity for independence. But the other side of that independence is a lack of
caring for anything beyond themselves. If they ask me once more “What’s this have to do with us?” I think I’ll
scream. Of course, I don’t scream. You have to treat them with care and fairness. Fairness is so important to them.
For example: these days I’m teaching The Call of the Wild. A student raised his hand to say he didn’t
understand “who was calling who.” Now if I were to laugh or mock, he would be insulted. And I would lose him.
This boy, Philip Malloy, is new to me. I met his parents at First Night, and they seem like pleasant folks; they
come regularly to PTA meetings. They are educated—she is, anyway. I’m not sure what they do.
But this Philip—an only son, by the way, which may be the problem—is only a middling student, and it’s a
shame. A nice-looking boy. A boy I like. Intelligent. With real potential. Perhaps that’s why he irritates me so—
for he shows no desire to strive, to make sacrifices for the betterment of self, the way we were taught. And, oh,
my, Anita, so restless! Worst of all, like so many of them, he exhibits no desire to learn. No ambition at all! But
it’s not even that I mind so much. No, it’s a certain something—a resistance—to accepting the idea that literature
is important. For him or anyone! But it is. It is! If I could only convince students of that. It’s that desire that keeps
me going.
I can hear you saying, “Come on down to Florida.” Anita, I don’t know if I am ready for that yet.
Yes, I could take early retirement. Mr. Benison (Science) is doing so. But then, he’s older than I. And he has a
wife who works. The truth is, Anita, I would be lost without my books, my teaching, my students.
I had a note from Ethel Truebel! Do you remember her? She used to be in the West Fork Church congregation
years ago. It seems …

Discussion in Bernard Lunser’s Homeroom Class
MR. LUNSER: Let’s go! Let’s go! Carpe diem. Time to grab the moment!
INTERCOM VOICE OF DR. GERTRUDE DOANE, HARRISON HIGH PRINCIPAL: Good morning to all students, faculty, and
staff. Today is Thursday, March 15. Today will be a Schedule A day.
MR. LUNSER: Get that, bozos? A day!
DR. DOANE: Today in history: on this day in 44 B.C., Julius Caesar was assassinated.
MR. LUNSER: And right after that they all sat down and ate a Caesar salad.
DR. DOANE: In 1767, Andrew Jackson, our seventh president, was born.
MR. LUNSER: So by the time this here Andy’s term was over, he was four years old.
DR. DOANE: It was in 1820 that Maine was admitted to the United States.
MR. LUNSER: And by 1821 they wanted out.
DR. DOANE: Please all rise and stand at respectful, silent attention for the playing of our national anthem.
Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming …
MR. LUNSER: Okay, Philip, is that yesterday’s homework or today’s you’re working on?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight …
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m trying to pass an exam.
MR. LUNSER: Ah, the famous wit and wisdom of Mr. Malloy. Philip, I’m the only one allowed to make jokes around
here. Put the book away.
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? …
PHILIP MALLOY:Just one last paragraph?
MR. LUNSER: Away, Philip! Or I’ll make you sing along solo!
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
MR. LUNSER: Okay. Move it out! Move it out! Hey, and be careful in those hallways.
STUDENT: What about announcements?
MR. LUNSER: Seems there aren’t any, for which we can all be grateful. Anyway, Philip needs the time to study for
his exam!
11:05 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Winter term exams next week. Hate them. Studying is so boring! I read the biology book for about twenty minutes
tonight. Then I realized I wasn’t really reading. Must have been asleep or something.
Three exams scheduled in one day!!! The trick is getting past the teacher. It’s like a race. You have to have a
strategy—know when to take it easy, know when to turn on the juice. Get teachers to think you’re in control. Have
to know when to kick. Like—put in one of their ideas. Or when all else fails make them laugh.
The exam I really want to study for is math. I could get a good mark. People think I’m weird, but I like math.
I won’t waste time on English. What can you say about a dog? Besides, it’s just a matter of opinion, anyway!!! If
I could only get Narwin to crack a smile.
Mom and Dad have been arguing a lot lately. Wonder what that means? Dad said his business is in a cash flow
squeeze. Mom says the phone company wants employees to pay more into the health plan. Says that’s not fair. Dad
says the point of business is to make the most money.
Been checking Allison out. She looked cool today. Dad says that when you’re a sports star girls really go for
you. Hey, Allison, remember me? Phil. Phil Malloy. Right! How would you like a box seat at the Olympics?
Mr. Bentcroft—on Washington Street—owes me for three weeks of newspapers. Talk about dogs!!!!
Sunny at first today. Then cloudy. Bit of rain. Then sunny again. Still, I got in a couple of hours of workout.
Mostly wind sprints. Then twenty minutes on Dad’s rowing machine.
I n Running magazine, there’s this guy, Steve Hallick, who’s 17, and he’s doing the 55 meters in 6.51
seconds!!!!
Track team practice season starts next week. Can’t wait. That’s all Dad and I talk about.

Phone Conversation between Philip Malloy and Allison Doresett
PHILIP MALLOY: Can I speak to Allison, please?
ALLISON DORESETT: This is she.
PHILIP MALLOY: Oh, Allison…. Hi. This is Phil.
ALLISON DORESETT: Phil?
PHILIP MALLOY: Philip Malloy.
ALLISON DORESETT: Oh, hi.
PHILIP MALLOY: What’s happening?
ALLISON DORESETT: Not much.
PHILIP MALLOY: Must have been something you ate.
ALLISON DORESETT: Disgusting!
PHILIP MALLOY: Hey, I … I was wondering … the English exam. Next week. You know? …
ALLISON DORESETT: Yes?
PHILIP MALLOY: Well, I thought … did you read the whole thing yet? Call of the Wild.
ALLISON DORESETT: Finished it last night. We’re supposed to review it all tomorrow, you know. For that exam.
PHILIP MALLOY: Allison …
ALLISON DORESETT: What?
PHILIP MALLOY: I lost my copy.
ALLISON DORESETT: You what?
PHILIP MALLOY: Wasn’t my fault. See, I had this idea—I thought I’d try reading it to a dog.
ALLISON DORESETT: A dog!
PHILIP MALLOY: Well, it’s about dogs, right? So I started to read it to him—this really mean dog—slobbering
mouth, running eyes, the whole bit—only, see, he grabs it and starts to run away.
ALLISON DORESETT: This isn’t true….
PHILIP MALLOY: No, listen! Don’t laugh! I’m serious! And I chased him into—I’m a runner, right?—chased him into
a yard and there he was—burying the book in the ground. I couldn’t get it back. The point is, he hated it too!
ALLISON DORESETT: You’re too much.
PHILIP MALLOY: So, I have to tell Narwin I couldn’t finish it.
ALLISON DORESETT: Right. Dare you to say that to her.
PHILIP MALLOY: Think I should?
ALLISON DORESETT: You always make remarks.
PHILIP MALLOY: Somebody’s got to keep the class awake.
ALLISON DORESETT: Yeah, but, hate to tell you, I liked the book.
PHILIP MALLOY: Whoops! Sorry, wrong number! Good-bye!
Excerpt from Margaret Narwin’s Winter Term Exam
Question four: What is the significance of Jack London’s choice in making Buck, the dog in The Call of the Wild,
the focus of his novel? Is the dog meant to be symbolic? Explain your answer. Can people learn from this
portrayal of a dog? Expand on these ideas.
Philip Malloy’s Answer to Exam-Question Four
The significance of Buck in Jack London’s novel The Call of the Wild is that Buck is symbolic of a cat. You might
think that cats have nothing to do with the book, but that is the point. Dogs are willing to sit around and have
writers write about them, which, in my personal opinion, makes them dumb. I think cats are smart. Cats don’t like
cold. A book that takes up so much time about a dog is pretty dumb. The book itself is a dog. That is what people
can learn from Jack London’s novel The Call of the Wild.
3:30 P.M.
Comment by Margaret Narwin on Philip Malloy’s Exam Paper
Philip, this is an unacceptable response. The Call of the Wild is an acknowledged masterpiece of American
literature. You are not required to like it. You—along with your fellow students— are required to give it your
respectful, thoughtful attention. In short, you are being asked to be more than lazy in your thinking.
Though your other answers are only a little better, I know you have the potential for good work. Your Fall term
work showed greater promise, though your classroom attitude leaves much to be desired. Now, Philip, if you do
not bring your work up, you are in danger of failing this course. When you get your Winter term grade, consider it
a warning.
EXAM GRADE: C–
TO: DR. GERTRUDE DOANE, PRINCIPAL, HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL
FROM: MARGARET NARWIN
RE: APPLICATION FOR GRANT
Attached please find my application to the State Office for Education for a summer grant-in-aid.
As you can see, I am applying to the State University for a summer program entitled “New Approaches to the
Teaching of Literature for Today’s Students.”
It’s an intensive two-week workshop in which university professors and high school “master teachers” will
present new ideas, theoretical as well as practical, for the experienced high school English teacher. The
application form requires both an approval and a recommendation from my head administrator, which is why I
write you.
I have been teaching for a long time. Indeed, you, Dr. Doane, one of my most successful students, will know
how long! I feel I am in need of new ideas, strategies, concepts to keep my teaching vital. The truth is—and I
believe I can speak honestly to you about this—I feel that sometimes I am a little out of touch with contemporary
teaching, and, just as important, the students who come before me these days. My love of literature—which has
served me so well all these years—is perhaps not enough. I want to find new works and new ways to entice the
young people of today.
In any case, you can easily see that the real beneficiaries of the program—if I am able to attend—will be the
students of Harrison High.
I know how reduced and restricted district money is these days, but over the years I have not asked for this kind
of support before. The State University tuition, two thousand dollars, is quite beyond my personal budget.
May I ask you to give this request your personal and immediate attention.
Sincerely,
MARGARET NARWIN
TO: ALL ADMINISTRATORS, FACULTY, AND STAFF
FROM: SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT SEYMOUR
Dear Colleagues:
As I am sure you are well aware, the April 5 municipal elections will have voters—for the second time—
casting ballots on the school budget. This time, in addition, a new Board of Education will be chosen.
Since the budget was rejected a month ago, we have worked very hard to cut our request for next year to the
bone. But there is still no guarantee that the voters will accept this budget either.
Throughout the U.S. we find that the aging population (living on restricted and/or shrinking incomes in an
inflation-prone world), along with reduced government support of education, conflicts with the needs of young
people who live in a society that demands educational excellence even while promoting passive acceptance of
mass-media culture.
I therefore urge all of you to talk to as many voters as possible in an effort to make clear our vision of the
educational future here in Harrison. Let me be blunt. A failure to win voter approval on this budget can only mean
major problems for programs and personnel.
In reference to the forthcoming board elections, I should like to remind you of this: tempers can flare; hot words
are often part of public debate. If, by chance, any controversial issue springs up between now and election day, I
would very much appreciate being informed as to the particulars. None of us likes to be taken unawares. If this
office can provide information and facts to the electorate, we shall all be better off. An informed voter is a wise
voter. Let us inform the voters with the truth.
Sincerely,
DR. ALBERT SEYMOUR, D.Ed.
School Superintendent
10:30 p.m.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Got my term grades. Math, an A. Awesome wicked. B– in biology. That’s OK too. And I got a C in history, which
is cool. All of that stuff is dead anyway. A straight B in health. But then I got a D in English!!! Narwin is so dumb
she didn’t get the joke.
I’ll have to try something different with her. Maybe I should tell her how boring she is. Bad combo—boring
teaching and stupid books. What she really wants us to do is put down the things she thinks. She wrote that on my
exam paper too. Wish I hadn’t thrown it out. It was funny. Bet Allison would have laughed. And now I’m going to
get Narwin for a homeroom teacher too. Not me.
Worked out with Mike at the track. Short sprints. Starts. Long runs. Calmed me down. Tryouts for the team on
Monday. Can’t wait. I know I’ll make it. Have to ask the folks to spring for those shoes.
Maybe I’ll give up the paper route.
There was this neat show on TV. Really scary. About these guys in Vietnam. Or maybe it was South America.
Doesn’t matter. Anyway, it has all this stuff about drug fighters and Arab spies. And the Mafia.
Sarah Gloss was reading this book The Outsiders. Said it was the best book she ever read. Said she’d give it to
me when she was done.
Saw Allison today. Did this thing. Swept off the cap. Big bow. She was trying to keep from cracking up. I’m
getting to her. It’s neat the way I can figure out what people think of me. Gives me a jump-start.
Tonight went out to this restaurant called Treasure Island. Seafood place. Dad loves seafood. He said I could
have anything on the menu but lobster. Had a couple of hamburgers and fries. He was sore. I wish people would
say what they mean.
Twenty minutes on the rowing machine.
Steve Hallick ran a mile in four seven!!!! I’d give anything if I could be like him.
TO: MARGARET NARWIN
FROM: DR. GERTRUDE DOANE, PRINCIPAL, HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL
RE: APPLICATION FOR GRANT
Dear Peg,
As much as I would like to be supportive, and while I can wholeheartedly approve of your desire to take the
workshop “New Approaches to the Teaching of Literature for Today’s Students,” I am afraid I cannot give it
formal approval.
The problem, as you may have foreseen, is severely limited district money.
Such funds as are available for teacher support of this nature have already been allocated. In fact, the last of
them just went to Kimberly Howard, the music teacher, who will be taking a summer course in Marching Band
Techniques, something that will give pleasure to so many people, and, it is hoped, encourage greater attendance at
athletic events. School Superintendent Seymour is very high on sports as a community bond. Need I say more?
Finally, with a budget crisis at hand—the budget vote looms large—it’s hard to plan anything at this time.
I do want to say, on a personal level, how much I admire your willingness to expand your intellectual and
teaching horizons. You have always been one of our best teachers, and I know you will continue to be so. If there
is any way I can facilitate your taking this course—other than with district funds—please let me know. You can
always count on me.
Sincerely,
DR. GERTRUDE DOANE

Discussion between Coach Earl Jamison and Philip Malloy
PHILIP MALLOY: Coach Jamison?
COACH JAMISON: Oh, Phil. Come on in, boy. Nice to see you. Sit down. Make yourself at home.
PHILIP MALLOY: I got your note. You wanted to see me.
COACH JAMISON: Been reading about the Philadelphia Classic Track Meet.
PHILIP MALLOY: Got a great runner from this school in Pittsburgh.
COACH JAMISON: Steve Hallick?
PHILIP MALLOY: Really great. Fast. And strong.
COACH JAMISON: Sure looks it.
PHILIP MALLOY: Coach Jamison …
COACH JAMISON: What’s that?
PHILIP MALLOY: I’ve been practicing every day. Working hard. I really have.
COACH JAMISON: Have you? That’s great. I heard you were a hard worker. That’s the way to do it. Your dad was a
runner, wasn’t he?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. He was good. Had to quit.
COACH JAMISON: What happened?
PHILIP MALLOY: Family stuff. His father got sick or something. Couldn’t stay in college.
COACH JAMISON: Yeah. It’s never easy.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m really up for the tryouts. I got some class shoes. Worked them in. I think we’re going to be
county champs.
COACH JAMISON: Hope so. Look, Phil, that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. I’ve got a copy of your winter term
grades here.
PHILIP MALLOY: You do?
COACH JAMISON: Well, I have to check these things. Saves problems later on. You know, there’s a school rule—
actually, a district rule—that you can’t be on a team unless you’ve got a passing grade in every subject. A
passing grade.
PHILIP MALLOY: A passing grade?
COACH JAMISON: Yeah. In high school. A passing grade.
PHILIP MALLOY: I didn’t know.
COACH JAMISON: Well, high school … The point is, Phil, see, here—look—it looks like you don’t have—see—all
passing grades. Look here, now. There’s a D here.
PHILIP MALLOY: I never heard that rule.
COACH JAMISON: In your student handbook. Read it?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t think anyone does.
COACH JAMISON: This grade isn’t too bad. And this grade. Fine. These. The one that really hurts is here. English.
Now, if you could have gotten that up a notch. Just a bit. Even a C minus. But a D isn’t—by the rules—passing.
So I guess we’ve got a problem.
PHILIP MALLOY: We do?
COACH JAMISON: Afraid so. Look—
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s Miss Narwin. I keep trying to get her to like me. She won’t. She’s so old-fashioned. Boring.
COACH JAMISON: Now, Phil. I know she’s tough. Is there any point in your talking to her?
PHILIP MALLOY: Me?
COACH JAMISON: Sure.
PHILIP MALLOY: Could you?
COACH JAMISON: What about your doing extra work? I mean, it’s no good this way.
PHILIP MALLOY: What do you mean?
COACH JAMISON: The rule … As it stands now, Phil—it’s not me saying this, but this rule—you’re not even
allowed to try out. And I’m not going to kid you. This does mess with the team.
PHILIP MALLOY: Honest. I didn’t know about that rule.
COACH JAMISON: Exactly. You need passing grades. See, rule’s been around for a long time.
PHILIP MALLOY: No one ever told me. And I’m practicing every day.
COACH JAMISON: Sure—
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s so unfair.
COACH JAMISON: Well, in high school—
PHILIP MALLOY: I mean, you can’t kid around with her or anything.
COACH JAMISON: Phil, if there is one thing sports teaches—and I’m always saying this—all the guys will tell you—
sometimes you have to go along to get along. That’s the whole thing about sports. Go with the flow.
PHILIP MALLOY: I think it’s a personal thing with her. It really is. She has it in for me. I mean, I shouldn’t be in her
class. Could you get me switched?
COACH JAMISON: Maybe if you talked to her. Do some catch-up work. How about it? Promise to hit the books.
Extra stuff. Bet you could. Look, everything I’ve heard suggests you are fast. Real potential. This is a big
disappointment.
PHILIP MALLOY: I mean, if I knew it was a rule—
COACH JAMISON: Yeah. One thing sports teaches. A rule is a rule. It isn’t always easy.
PHILIP MALLOY: I didn’t know.
COACH JAMISON: Well, thing is, now you do.
1:30 P.M.
Discussion in Margaret Narwin’s English Class
MISS NARWIN: Now, class, during the first few weeks of this new term we’ll be reading William Shakespeare’s
Julius Caesar. How many of you have ever read a play by Shakespeare before? Well, then, you’re in for a
treat. You are not an educated person unless you have read Shakespeare. Philip?
PHILIP MALLOY: What?
MISS NARWIN: I’d rather you look up at me, not out the window.
PHILIP MALLOY: I was listening.
MISS NARWIN: Can you repeat what I said?
PHILIP MALLOY: We’re reading something.
MISS NARWIN: William Shakespeare.
PHILIP MALLOY: Whatever you say.
MISS NARWIN: Philip, I think I’ve suggested before that your comments can be tiresome. Now, please, try to stay
with me.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
6:23 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MRS. MALLOY: Honey, did you have a chance to look at Phil’s grades?
MR. MALLOY: What?
MRS. MALLOY: Did you look at Phil’s grades. I left them on the bureau.
MR. MALLOY: Uh, yes. Where is he?
MRS. MALLOY: In the basement. On your rowing machine.
MR. MALLOY: Should use that thing more myself. Putting on weight.
MRS. MALLOY: You certainly are. Did you?
MR. MALLOY: I’m looking at them now.
MRS. MALLOY: What do you think?
MR. MALLOY: Not too bad. Except for English. What’s the problem there?
MRS. MALLOY: He says it’s the teacher.
MR. MALLOY: I’ve seen him read.
MRS. MALLOY: He’s reading some paperback. Insiders. Outsiders. I don’t know. Some girl gave it to him. That
doesn’t seem to be the problem.
MR. MALLOY: I never was one for reading much. I mean, other than sports. Course now, papers. Too much of that.
MRS. MALLOY: Ben, he could flunk that course.
MR. MALLOY: Won’t be the end of the world. What would he have to do, go to summer school? Maybe that’s the
lesson he needs. Kids only do what they want to do.
MRS. MALLOY: The last couple of days he’s been very moody.
MR. MALLOY: Come on. He’s fourteen.
MRS. MALLOY: He doesn’t want to talk. To me, anyway. Maybe you should be spending more time with him.
MR. MALLOY: I know. All tied up in this—
MRS. MALLOY: I understand. But work’s better, isn’t it?
MR. MALLOY: Some. Did he make the track team?
MRS. MALLOY: You know, I completely forgot to ask him. Maybe that’s the problem.
MR. MALLOY: I’ll talk to him.
MRS. MALLOY: Do you know—about a week ago, he asked me if we—you and I—were getting a divorce?
MR. MALLOY: What?
MRS. MALLOY: Really.
MR. MALLOY: How’d he come up with that?
MRS. MALLOY: I’m not sure. Maybe he overheard…. I told him bickering happens in a marriage. It’s perfectly
normal. Life isn’t a sitcom.
MR. MALLOY: Right. The real world doesn’t have a laugh track.
8:50 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy and His Father
MR. MALLOY: Can I talk to you?
PHILIP MALLOY: Sure.
MR. MALLOY: How much time you spending on this?
PHILIP MALLOY: Few times a day. Short sprints.
MR. MALLOY: Like I’m always telling you, just make sure you warm up each time. But it’s good for the back. Helps
with starts.
PHILIP MALLOY: I know.
MR. MALLOY: Uh, Phil … School stuff. Straight up. What’s the story in English?
PHILIP MALLOY: What do you mean?
MR. MALLOY: I saw your grades. Most of them are decent. What’s with English?
PHILIP MALLOY: I can speak it.
MR. MALLOY: Seriously….
PHILIP MALLOY: You want the truth?
MR. MALLOY: Sure. Well?
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s the teacher, Narwin.
MR. MALLOY: What do you mean?
PHILIP MALLOY: She has it in for me.
MR. MALLOY: How come?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know. Nobody likes her. People don’t do well in her classes. Except her favorites.
MR. MALLOY: Want me or your ma to go in and talk to her?
PHILIP MALLOY: I can handle her.
MR. MALLOY: What are you reading in school?
PHILIP MALLOY: Julius Caesar. Shakespeare.
MR. MALLOY: Uh-oh.
PHILIP MALLOY: So bad. This Narwin has us reading these tiny bits every night, but no one understands it. I mean it,
no one!!! She says it’s English, but it must have been English before the English got there. At least it’s not any
English I’ve ever heard.
MR. MALLOY: Well, reading is important.
PHILIP MALLOY: I read. Ever hear of The Outsiders? It’s about these guys—they live alone—without parents.
MR. MALLOY: Think I saw it on cable. How you getting on with the track team? Phil?
PHILIP MALLOY: I, ah … was thinking I wouldn’t try out.
MR. MALLOY: Come again?
PHILIP MALLOY: Thinking of not trying out.
MR. MALLOY: You kidding?
PHILIP MALLOY: No.
MR. MALLOY: But high school track is … Why?
PHILIP MALLOY: Lot of reasons.
MR. MALLOY: Like what?
PHILIP MALLOY: Dad …
MR. MALLOY: I want to know.
PHILIP MALLOY:Just because you did it doesn’t mean I have to.
MR. MALLOY: Now, wait a minute. You’re really into it. We just got you new shoes. And you’re good. Better than I
ever was. You are. I love watching you run. You shouldn’t give it up. And here you are working out. I don’t get
it. What’s going on?
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing.
MR. MALLOY: Didn’t you tell me the coach asked you to be on the team?
PHILIP MALLOY: Doesn’t mean—
MR. MALLOY: Phil, I don’t get it.
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s my choice.
MR. MALLOY: Phil, let me tell you something. If God gives you a ticket, you better use it.
PHILIP MALLOY: Ticket to what?
MR. MALLOY: Running.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’ll think about it.
MR. MALLOY: Those shoes weren’t cheap either. Real first-class stuff. I mean, I don’t understand. I thought you
were ready for it.
PHILIP MALLOY: Come on, Dad. I’m not you.
9:24 P.M.
From a Letter Written by Margaret Narwin to Her Sister, Anita Wigham
… Anita, the truth is I’m hurt. Never in all the years I’ve been at Harrison have I asked for anything in the way of
extra funds. If it were a case of no money available for anyone, why, I could accept that. But, no, a certain
Kimberly Howard, who has been here for only two years, and who has a husband who works for some large
corporation, she received money! And for some idiotic course in marching-band music! It makes me outraged to
think about it.
What has happened to our society? Where are its values?
I suppose marching bands make a big show. Bread and circuses, Anita. Bread and circuses. That’s all it is. I
don’t think I’ve ever been so angry!
I think there’s a question of fairness here. That old-fashioned word respect—how often Mother used it!—
occurs to me often these days. Call it pride, call it vanity, but I would like some respect for all I have done here.
From the community. From the administration. Yes, from the students. I work hard for them!
The truth is it’s our superintendent’s doing. There is a second budget vote coming up. I told you the first one
failed. He sent out a memo to everybody warning us that it might fail again. Almost a threat. He is a very political
person. But then, all he wants is to keep his job.
Oh, I am so angry….
10:40 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Folks got my grades. Ma asked me a few things about them before supper. I didn’t say much. Then, afterward, Dad
talked to me. About the grades. Wasn’t that he blew his stack or anything. I told him the truth. He seemed to
understand. But then he asked me about my being on the track team. Didn’t know what to say. If I told him what
happened he would have been really mad. So I just said I decided I wouldn’t go for the tryouts.
That got him upset.
I just realized two things that make me want to puke. Track practice starts tomorrow and I’m not on the team.
Also, I start homeroom with Narwin!!!!! Can’t stand even looking at her. I have to find a way to get transferred
out.
11:45 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MRS. MALLOY: Did you talk to Philip? About that grade?
MR. MALLOY: Sure.
MRS. MALLOY: What’s going on?
MR. MALLOY: I’m not sure. Fussing with the English teacher.
MRS. MALLOY: What do you mean?
MR. MALLOY: Like he told you. He doesn’t like her. I told him he didn’t have much choice. Take the bad with the
good. Then he said he wasn’t going to try out for track.
MRS. MALLOY: That he was not?
MR. MALLOY: That’s what he told me.
MRS. MALLOY: But that’s all he thinks about.
MR. MALLOY: I know. He doesn’t know how good he is. I reminded him.
MRS. MALLOY: Did he give a reason?
MR. MALLOY: Not really. Something about not having to do what I did.
MRS. MALLOY: Oh, he’ll change his mind. Kids are so moody.
MR. MALLOY: Hope so.
MRS. MALLOY: Maybe just don’t mention it.
MR. MALLOY: Maybe.
MRS. MALLOY: I’m glad you spoke to him. Not every father would.
MR. MALLOY: He doesn’t make it easy.
7:30 A.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Ken Barchet on the Way to the School Bus
PHILIP MALLOY: What’s happening, man?
KEN BARCHET: Nothing. Got room changes. Who’d you get?
PHILIP MALLOY: Narwin.
KEN BARCHET: So do I. She’s okay.
PHILIP MALLOY: Can’t stand her.
KEN BARCHET: Doesn’t matter. It’s just homeroom.
PHILIP MALLOY: No way. I’ve got her for English too. I’m going to get transferred out of both.
KEN BARCHET: Why?
PHILIP MALLOY: Told you. Can’t stand her.
KEN BARCHET: How you going to do that?
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m working on it.
KEN BARCHET: Sure … Malloy Magic, right?
PHILIP MALLOY: You’ll see.
8:03 A.M.
Discussion in Margaret Narwin’s Homeroom Class
MISS NARWIN: Ladies and gentlemen, please settle down. All right. Settle down. For the moment just take any seat
you wish. We’ll work out particular problems a bit later on. Yes?
STUDENT: Am I supposed to be in this room?
MISS NARWIN: What’s your name?
STUDENT: Lisa Gibbons.
MISS NARWIN: Lisa? Yes, you’re on my list. Just take any seat for the moment.
STUDENT: Miss Narwin, what about me?
MISS NARWIN: Is that you, Gloria? No, you’re not here. Did you get a notice?
GLORIA: No.
MISS NARWIN: Oh, dear. Best check in the main office.
ALLISON DORESETT: What about me?
MISS NARWIN: You’ll all have to lower your voices if I’m going to sort things out. Yes, Allison, you are here. Yes?
STUDENT:Joseph R. Rippens.
MISS NARWIN: I think that—
INTERCOM VOICE OF DR. GERTRUDE DOANE, HARRISON HIGH PRINCIPAL: Good morning to all students, faculty, and
staff.
STUDENT: Am I?
MISS NARWIN: Please, let’s just get done with the morning business.
DR. DOANE: Today is Wednesday, March 28. Today will be a Schedule B day.
Today in history: in the year A.D. 193 the Roman Emperor Pertinax was assassinated. On this day in 1862
the Civil War battle of Glorieta, New Mexico, was fought. Today in Czechoslovakia it is Teachers’ Day.
Please all rise and stand at respectful, silent attention for the playing of our national anthem.
Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light …
MISS NARWIN: Is that someone humming?
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars …
MISS NARWIN: I don’t know who that is, but you heard Dr. Doane request silence.
… through the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? …
MISS NARWIN: Is that you, Philip?
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air …
PHILIP MALLOY:Just humming.
MISS NARWIN: Please stop it.
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there….
PHILIP MALLOY: Mr. Lunser doesn’t mind. I just—
MISS NARWIN: Stop it now.
PHILIP MALLOY: But—
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave …
MISS NARWIN: Now! Thank you.
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
10:30 A.M.
Discussion between Margaret Narwin and Jacob Benison, Science Teacher, in the Faculty Room
MR. BENISON: Morning, Peg. How’s it going? Lots of confusion with the new homerooms?
MISS NARWIN: I’ll get through it.
MR. BENISON: Awful lot of mix-ups. Kids going every which way. As if they weren’t informed. Happens this way
every year. Sometimes I think it’s not worth the trouble.
MISS NARWIN: I agree.
MR. BENISON: I’ll be glad to get out of it. Forty-four more days!
MISS NARWIN: Sometimes I think I should join you.
MR. BENISON: Can’t wait. Get you some coffee? Kim brought in muffins.
MISS NARWIN: Kim?
MR. BENISON: Kimberly Howard. Music.
MISS NARWIN: I’ll just sit here.
MR. BENISON: Something the matter, Peg?
MISS NARWIN: Oh, stupid business. I suppose it’s this changing homeroom classes. The announcements, and so on.
And when the national anthem comes on, the students are supposed to stand in silence.
MR. BENISON: Right. “Respect, silence, and attention,” I think the rule reads.
MISS NARWIN: Exactly. I had a student who started to hum loudly. Very loudly.
MR. BENISON: Uh-oh. Who was that?
MISS NARWIN: Philip Malloy.
MR. BENISON: Oh, sure, Phil. Nice kid. Bright—when he gets around to doing some work. Which isn’t exactly every
day. He’s got being fast on his brain. Humming loudly? What was he doing that for?
MISS NARWIN: I don’t know. I had to ask him to stop.
MR. BENISON: Did he?
MISS NARWIN: Not at first. I spoke to him twice. He claimed he always did it before.
MR. BENISON: That right?
MISS NARWIN: Bernie Lunser’s class.
MR. BENISON: Oh? Well, the term won’t last forever.
MISS NARWIN: Sometimes I wonder. Maybe I will get some coffee.
MR. BENISON: Hey, the meaning of life!
12:15 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy and Todd Becker in the School Lunchroom
TODD BECKER: Hey, man, how come you aren’t going out for track?
PHILIP MALLOY: Got too much to do.
TODD BECKER: We could use you, man. Need some power. We really could.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’ll think about it.
TODD BECKER: You should.
PHILIP MALLOY:Just don’t bug me.
TODD BECKER: Sure. Sure. I’m just asking. Who’d you get for homeroom?
PHILIP MALLOY: What?
TODD BECKER: Who’s your new homeroom teacher?
PHILIP MALLOY: Narwin.
TODD BECKER: I like her.
PHILIP MALLOY: I hate her.
TODD BECKER: Yeah? How come?
PHILIP MALLOY: She is the stupidest teacher…. You know how they play “The Star-Spangled Banner” in the
morning … ?
TODD BECKER: Yeah….
PHILIP MALLOY: Well, I started to sing it….
TODD BECKER: Why?
PHILIP MALLOY: Felt like it.
TODD BECKER: So?
PHILIP MALLOY: She told me to stop.
TODD BECKER: Stop what?
PHILIP MALLOY: Humming.
TODD BECKER: Thought you said singing.
PHILIP MALLOY: Whatever.
TODD BECKER: How come she made you stop?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know. She’s got something against me. I don’t know what it is. She really has it in for me.
Something. I mean, she’s always onto me about something. Really. I wish I knew.
TODD BECKER: What did you do?
PHILIP MALLOY: I told you. Nothing.
TODD BECKER: No. I mean when she told you to stop humming.
PHILIP MALLOY: I stopped.
TODD BECKER: Man, those are the biggest cookies I ever saw. Like pizzas.
PHILIP MALLOY: My mother makes them.
TODD BECKER: Amazing.
PHILIP MALLOY: Here. Take a piece. Humming, would you believe it? No way I’m staying in her classes.
1:40 P.M.
Discussion in Margaret Narwin’s English Class
MISS NARWIN: Now, scene two, line fifty-two. Brutus says, “No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself / But by
reflection, by some other things.” What does he mean by that? Anyone? Someone want to take a chance?
Roger?
ROGER SANCHEZ: That he can’t see himself.
MISS NARWIN: Close. Yes, Philip?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah, but what if he’s cross-eyed? He’d see himself then, wouldn’t he?
MISS NARWIN: Philip, I’m not even going to respond to that! Terri?
3:15 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy and Allison Doresett on the School Bus
ALLISON DORESETT: Can I sit next to you?
PHILIP MALLOY: Oh, sure. Sure.
ALLISON DORESETT: What’s the matter? You look like death warmed over.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m okay.
ALLISON DORESETT: You got Miss Narwin mad with that joke in English.
PHILIP MALLOY: She’s always mad at me.
ALLISON DORESETT: Is something the matter?
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing.
ALLISON DORESETT: School was so frantic today.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
ALLISON DORESETT: All the sports and stuff. Hey, how come you didn’t go to track tryouts?
PHILIP MALLOY: Had to do something.
ALLISON DORESETT: Todd said you were really great. That with you on the team we were going to be county
champs.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
ALLISON DORESETT: Boy, you’re in a mood!
PHILIP MALLOY:Just don’t feel like talking.
ALLISON DORESETT: Well excuse me!
PHILIP MALLOY: Hey, Allison, wait … Damn!
3:20 P.M.
Discussion between Margaret Narwin and Bernard Lunser Outside the School’s Main Office
MISS NARWIN: Bernie!
MR. LUNSER: Oh, hi, Peg. How you doing?
MISS NARWIN: Fine. I need to ask you something.
MR. LUNSER: What’s that?
MISS NARWIN: In your morning homeroom …
MR. LUNSER: Yeah?
MISS NARWIN: When the national anthem is played …
MR. LUNSER: Right …
MISS NARWIN: Do you allow your students to sing along?
MR. LUNSER: Sing?
MISS NARWIN: During the national anthem.
MR. LUNSER: Ummmmmm … I thought the kids are supposed to be quiet.
MISS NARWIN: One of my new homeroom students, Philip Malloy, informed me that you always allowed singing.
MR. LUNSER: Oh, Philip … Right. He was in my homeroom. He’d do better if he thought himself a little less clever
and got his brain into something besides running. But I like him. A decent kid. You get him?
MISS NARWIN: Do you allow singing?
MR. LUNSER: Singing?
MISS NARWIN: Yes.
MR. LUNSER: The rule says keep quiet….
MISS NARWIN: But do you allow singing?
MR. LUNSER: Hey, Peg, do I look like a guy who goes around breaking important rules?
MISS NARWIN: Thanks.
7:15 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy and His Parents During Dinner
MRS. MALLOY: You seem very quiet tonight, Philip. Want some more gravy?
PHILIP MALLOY: I’ve got enough.
MR. MALLOY: I’ll have some. What did you decide to do about the track team?
MRS. MALLOY: Philip, your father asked you something.
PHILIP MALLOY: What?
MR. MALLOY: I asked you a question. You still not going out for track?
MRS. MALLOY: Philip, is something the matter?
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m not on the team.
MR. MALLOY: I know that’s what you said. But I’d like to know why. Something must be the matter.
PHILIP MALLOY: What would you say …
MRS. MALLOY: Phil, don’t talk with your mouth full.
MR. MALLOY: Have I ever missed one of your meets? Ever? This boy is the best runner in town. Makes me feel
proud.
MRS. MALLOY: Ben, we know that. What were you saying, Phil?
PHILIP MALLOY: What would you say if a teacher said I wasn’t allowed to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner”?
MR. MALLOY: What?
PHILIP MALLOY: Singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
MR. MALLOY: Anywhere?
PHILIP MALLOY: In class.
MRS. MALLOY: I don’t understand. What’s this have to do with what your father asked—your running? Singing in the
middle of class?
PHILIP MALLOY: Ma, listen! I’m trying to tell you. I mean … you know, when school starts, first period, homeroom,
when they play, you know, the … song over the speaker system. It’s a tape.
MR. MALLOY: Come again.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m trying to explain!
MR. MALLOY: No need to raise your voice!
MRS. MALLOY: The both of you …
MR. MALLOY: Now, Philip, just tell us what—obviously, something has happened. Calmly and factually, tell us
what happened. Why you are so upset?
PHILIP MALLOY: I told you…. In school today …
MR. MALLOY: Okay. In school today. But what?
PHILIP MALLOY: We got new homeroom teachers.
MRS. MALLOY:Just you?
PHILIP MALLOY: No. I never said that. Everybody. The whole school.
MRS. MALLOY: I don’t understand.
MR. MALLOY: Susan, just let Phil tell his story without interruptions.
MRS. MALLOY: I’m just trying to understand.
PHILIP MALLOY: Anyway, I got this Miss Narwin. She’s a real bitch….
MR. MALLOY: Phil!
PHILIP MALLOY: Do you want to know what happened or not!
MRS. MALLOY: Honey, let the boy tell it his way.
PHILIP MALLOY: Anyway, they always start off the day, you know, with playing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” Okay.
It’s stupid, but, well, sometimes I sort of sing along….
MRS. MALLOY: You have a very sweet voice.
PHILIP MALLOY: Or hum….
MR. MALLOY: Hum?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. Right. Hum. No big deal. But this teacher, she got real mad and started to yell at me to stop.
MRS. MALLOY: She yelled?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
MR. MALLOY: Let me understand this. Just—out of the blue—she yelled at you because you were—?
PHILIP MALLOY: Right. Humming. That’s all I was doing, I mean, not loud. Soft.
MR. MALLOY: And she yelled at you?
PHILIP MALLOY: That’s what I’m trying to say.
MRS. MALLOY: That’s not what I’d call fair.
MR. MALLOY: The national anthem—“Oh, say, can you see”—is that what you’re talking about?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
MR. MALLOY: You have some more of that … ?
MRS. MALLOY: Yams. Sweet yams.
MR. MALLOY: Thanks. They’re delicious. Now where is he going?
MRS. MALLOY: He was trying to talk, and you weren’t listening to him. Ben, you have to be more supportive!
MR. MALLOY: What do you mean?
MRS. MALLOY: Maybe that’s why he isn’t running. Maybe he’s sending a message.
MR. MALLOY: Like what?
MRS. MALLOY: That he needs your support on something that isn’t track. That’s him.
MR. MALLOY: Think so?
MRS. MALLOY: I don’t know. Just trying to understand.
MR. MALLOY: My day wasn’t so great either.
MRS. MALLOY: Oh?
MR. MALLOY: Remember that bid we put in on that Colfax job? …
8:32 P.M.
From a Letter Written by Margaret Narwin to Her Sister, Anita Wigham
… I do think it’s quite the best thing Barbara Pym ever wrote. It’s one of those books about which—even as I
neared the end—I said to myself, “I can’t wait to read this again.”
In any case, it was so soothing to come home to that quiet, thoughtful, civilized British world. Oh, Anita, I long
to return to England someday, and those wonderful, leisurely late-afternoon cream teas….
The truth is, I needed a soothing. Today was “Spring Changeover Day,” when our students, after six months of
struggling to learn exactly where to go, are suddenly tossed pell-mell here, there, anywhere, as their schedules and
homeroom assignments shift because of spring recreational schedules. Of course, bedlam is always the result, with
attendant bad feeling. It’s just at those moments that students rear up and challenge your authority. One has to be
vigilant and firm. As well as consistent and fair. That’s the key with students these days. And sometimes I haven’t
the stamina for it. Ah, well …
Thank you for passing on the kind words of Mr. Chevers. Of course I remember him….
9:05 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Today was rotten. Nothing was right. I felt like punching Narwin in the face. It all just stinks.
9:20 P.M.
Phone Conversation between Allison Doresett and Janet Barsky
ALLISON DORESETT: Oh, on the bus coming home, you know, I was going to sit with Phil Malloy.
JANET BARSKY: You like him, don’t you?
ALLISON DORESETT: He’s kind of cute. And usually really funny. But he looked upset today. Angry.
JANET BARSKY: How come?
ALLISON DORESETT: I don’t know. He was that way in class too. I tried to talk to him, but he wouldn’t. Anyway, I
didn’t sit with him.
JANET BARSKY: Who’d you sit with?
ALLISON DORESETT: Todd Becker.
JANET BARSKY: Todd! Too cool! He’s the cutest guy!
ALLISON DORESETT: I know…. And he always makes me laugh.
10:45 P.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and His Father
MR. MALLOY: Phil? You up? Can I speak to you?
PHILIP MALLOY: Oh, sure. Just reading.
MR. MALLOY: What’re you reading?
PHILIP MALLOY: The Outsiders.
MR. MALLOY: Still?
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s pretty long.
MR. MALLOY: Can I sit down?
PHILIP MALLOY: Sure.
MR. MALLOY: Now, look, this business about, you know, what you were saying at dinner, not being allowed to sing
the national anthem …
PHILIP MALLOY: I was humming.
MR. MALLOY: Whatever. Now, your mother and I talked about this. I mean, I want you to understand—whatever it is
—we’re on your side.
PHILIP MALLOY: I didn’t think you were interested.
MR. MALLOY: Of course I’m interested. I’m always cheering on your side.
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s just that the teacher—
MR. MALLOY: No, wait. Straight up. I think she’s wrong. No two ways about it. You’re right to be bugged. She
shouldn’t put you down like that. You know, I’m—your mother and I—we’re no great, well, you know, no big
patriots. I don’t think we even own a flag. But that doesn’t mean we don’t love our country. Believe me. We
just don’t make a big thing about it. It’s not that kind of showy thing with us. But not being allowed to sing “The
Star-Spangled Banner” … Well, that’s like, sort of, not being allowed to, you know, pray. A personal thing.
And the personal thing, in America … the point is, it doesn’t seem right. And we just want you to know we’re
with you. It’s important to us that you know that.
PHILIP MALLOY: Thanks.
MR. MALLOY: Your mother says to be more supportive. Well, sure. I mean, I’ll stand with you. You never have to
worry about that.
PHILIP MALLOY: You’re not mad?
MR. MALLOY: Of course not. I have half a mind to talk to Ted.
PHILIP MALLOY: Why?
MR. MALLOY: He’s running for school board. Election soon. I mean, Ted Griffen is our neighbor. That can mean
something.
PHILIP MALLOY: He was always chasing me off his lawn.
MR. MALLOY: Yeah. But you were a kid then. Phil, let me tell you something. One thing I’ve learned is this: you
really have to stick up for your rights. We’ll stand with you. Don’t worry. See you at breakfast.
PHILIP MALLOY: Right.
MR. MALLOY: Night, kid.
PHILIP MALLOY: Night.
MR. MALLOY: Remember. You stick up for your rights. I’ll be there.
8:02 A.M.
Discussion in Margaret Narwin’s Homeroom Class
MISS NARWIN: Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats. Your assigned seats. I need to take attendance.
STUDENT: Miss Narwin.
MISS NARWIN: Yes?
STUDENT: Peggy Lord is sick.
MISS NARWIN: Thank you.
INTERCOM VOICE OF DR. GERTRUDE DOANE, HARRISON HIGH PRINCIPAL: Good morning to all students, faculty, and
staff. Today is Thursday, March 29. Today will be a Schedule A day.
Today in history: in the year 1790 our tenth president, John Tyler, was born. In 1918 singer Pearl Bailey
was born. And today in 1954 Karen Ann Quinlan was born.
Please all rise and stand at respectful, silent attention for the playing of our national anthem.
Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light …
MISS NARWIN: Is that someone humming?
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars …
MISS NARWIN: Philip, is that you again?
… through the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? …
MISS NARWIN: Philip, I spoke to you yesterday about this.
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air …
MISS NARWIN: This is a time for listening. Now, please, stop singing.
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there….
MISS NARWIN: Philip, stop this insolence!
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
MISS NARWIN: Philip, leave this room instantly. Report to Dr. Palleni’s office. Now!
8:35 A.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Dr. Joseph Palleni, Assistant Principal, Harrison High
DR. PALLENI: Okay, Philip, come on in. Sit yourself down. Who’s your homeroom teacher?
PHILIP MALLOY: Miss Narwin.
DR. PALLENI: Okay. Now, what seems to be the problem?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know.
DR. PALLENI: Come on, Phil. Sit up straight. We don’t whip people here. Now, you must have some idea. She asked
you to leave the class. What happened?
PHILIP MALLOY: She doesn’t like me.
DR. PALLENI: Let’s try to be more specific, Philip. I want to hear your side of the problem. I’ll check with her.
Then, let’s see if we can work something out. We’re into solving problems, not making them. Okay. Now, what
happened?
PHILIP MALLOY: She wouldn’t let me sing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
DR. PALLENI: What?
PHILIP MALLOY: She won’t let me sing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
DR. PALLENI: I don’t understand.
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s just a thing I like to do. Sing along when the song is played.
DR. PALLENI: “The Star-Spangled Banner”?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. I just like to do it. In Mr. Lunser’s—
DR. PALLENI: You mean—when the morning tape plays … ?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
DR. PALLENI: And you were singing?
PHILIP MALLOY: Uh-huh.
DR. PALLENI: What, loudly? Disrespectfully? Were you making fun?
PHILIP MALLOY: No. Not at all. Just, you know, sort of to myself. Almost humming. Really. I always do.
DR. PALLENI: There’s a rule about being quiet at that time.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah, well, it’s sort of a … patriotic thing with me. But the whole thing is, she always has it in for
me.
DR. PALLENI: Who?
PHILIP MALLOY: Narwin. So, she kicked me out.
DR. PALLENI: This singing you were doing … singing out loud. Did Miss Narwin ask you to stop?
PHILIP MALLOY: I mean, I wasn’t being loud or anything like that.
DR. PALLENI: And did you? Stop, I mean.
PHILIP MALLOY: No, I told you. I was singing.
DR. PALLENI: But, when she—Miss Narwin—asked you, did you stop?
PHILIP MALLOY: It was just to myself. Not loud or anything, and—
DR. PALLENI: Okay, okay, Phil. I think I understand now. No problem. Where is that thing? … Here it is. This is a
memo from Dr. Doane. Look, see what it says. Go on, read it. What does it say? Silent. Okay? You hear it
every day. Right? But you were singing. Right? No, let me finish. Miss Narwin asked you to stop. You didn’t.
You continued to sing. You were disobedient. So she asked you to leave.
PHILIP MALLOY: How can you ask someone not to sing “The Star-Spangled Banner”?
DR. PALLENI: It’s the rule.
PHILIP MALLOY: Is a memo a rule?
DR. PALLENI: Philip …
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah, but …
DR. PALLENI: Philip, look. I’ve got more important things to do with my time than argue with you about following
simple, basic rules. I’ve got serious infractions. I’ve got drugs. I’ve got—
PHILIP MALLOY: Put me in another homeroom.
DR. PALLENI: What?
PHILIP MALLOY: Put me in another homeroom. And another English class.
DR. PALLENI: What’s English have to do with this? Philip, I asked you something.
PHILIP MALLOY: She and I don’t get along.
DR. PALLENI: Look, Phil, you are here to get an education. To get along you have to go along. Let’s not make a big
deal over this, okay, Phil? Now, you’ve given me your side of the story. I’ll check with Miss Narwin, but it
seems pretty clear to me…. You said yourself, you broke a rule—
PHILIP MALLOY: If you could just change …
DR. PALLENI: Here’s a note that says I spoke to you. Scoot. Get along with your day. Make it a good one.
PHILIP MALLOY: But …
DR. PALLENI: Hey, Phil, be cool. It’s a good day. I heard you’re a runner. It’s a great day for running. Go join the
track team. They could use you. Okay? Now, take it easy. See you around. Bye. Have a nice day.
1:35 P.M.
Conversation between Mr. Malloy and His Boss, Mr. Dexter
MR. DEXTER: Look, Ben, it was just a botched job, that’s all. There are no two ways around it.
MR. MALLOY: Mr. Dexter, what I’m simply trying to explain is that I wasn’t given all the information that would
allow me—
MR. DEXTER: I don’t want to hear excuses, Ben. I want someone around here to accept responsibility. Is that you or
not?
MR. MALLOY: Yes, sir.
MR. DEXTER: It goes with your position. Responsibility. Just don’t let it happen again. We lost a lot of money on this
one. We can’t afford it. No one should know that better than you.
MR. MALLOY: Yes, sir.
MR. DEXTER: Okay. That’s all that needs to be said. It’s done. We’ll work around it.
MR. MALLOY: Yes, sir.
MR. DEXTER: Regular sales-reps meeting tomorrow morning. I don’t intend to bring this up. But it will be on my
mind. We can’t afford another screwup.
MR. MALLOY: Yes, sir.
3:35 P.M.
Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Dr. Gertrude Doane, Principal, Harrison High
DR. DOANE: Come in, Peg. Come in.
MISS NARWIN: Thank you.
DR. DOANE: Do sit down. Would you like some coffee?
MISS NARWIN: No, thank you.
DR. DOANE: Peg, ever since you sent me that note about funds for that summer teaching workshop, I’ve been
meaning to speak to you.
MISS NARWIN: You’re very busy.
DR. DOANE: Busy? Good grief. Superintendent Seymour has us writing position papers, speaking to chamber of
commerce groups … the Rotary club. The upcoming budget vote. He’s very nervous about it. And the board
election. But that’s something else. You don’t want to hear about that. Many is the time I wish I were back in
the classroom. Though, actually, it was while doing some statistics for this budget vote business that I was able
to pull something together that’s interesting.
MISS NARWIN: Yes?
DR. DOANE: You know how, in your memo, you spoke of going to that workshop—that some of the instructors were
—what?—“master teachers.”
MISS NARWIN: Yes.
DR. DOANE: Wish we had that program here. The point is, Peg, you are the one who should be a master teacher.
MISS NARWIN: Thank you, but …
DR. DOANE: I mean, what I came up with is this…. There is a direct statistical tie-in—that is, those students who
have taken an English class with you, Peg, score higher on the Iowa tests, the Stanfords, and the SAT verbals.
MISS NARWIN: Is that right?
DR. DOANE: No question. I could show you the figures.
MISS NARWIN: Well, that’s nice to know.
DR. DOANE: I felt so bad about not being able to give you that funding. But, Peg, if the truth be known … you don’t
need it. You—the facts are there for all to see—you are our best English teacher. I didn’t have to be told that.
But there’s the truth for the rest of the world to see.
MISS NARWIN: Thank you, Gert. I really appreciate that. I really do.
6:10 P.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MRS. MALLOY: Hi, honey.
MR. MALLOY: ’Lo.
MRS. MALLOY: What’s the matter? Something wrong?
MR. MALLOY: Got chewed out by Dexter.
MRS. MALLOY: What for?
MR. MALLOY: Some job estimate that went wrong. Wasn’t even anything I did.
MRS. MALLOY: I hope you stood up for yourself.
MR. MALLOY: Are you kidding?
MRS. MALLOY: But, honey, if you were right …
MR. MALLOY: And get myself in his bad books.
MRS. MALLOY: You wouldn’t get yourself—
MR. MALLOY: Susan, please don’t bug me about it. I know when to keep my mouth shut.
MRS. MALLOY: But—
MR. MALLOY: You don’t understand. I’m sorry I mentioned it. Look, I’m just not in a position of power there. Okay?
Just forget it, okay? Just forget it. It’s no big thing.
MRS. MALLOY: Sorry I asked.
7:10 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy and His Parents During Dinner
PHILIP MALLOY: It happened again.
MRS. MALLOY: What happened?
PHILIP MALLOY: In school. This morning. I was singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The teacher kicked me out.
MR. MALLOY: You kidding?
PHILIP MALLOY: No, it’s true.
MRS. MALLOY: Sent you out of the classroom?
PHILIP MALLOY: To the assistant principal’s office.
MR. MALLOY: I hope you stood up for yourself.
PHILIP MALLOY: I spoke to Palleni.
MR. MALLOY: Who?
PHILIP MALLOY: Assistant principal.
MR. MALLOY: What did he say?
PHILIP MALLOY: Sided with Narwin.
MR. MALLOY: Phil, listen to me. Don’t give in to that crap. Don’t let them push you around. Singing the … There
must be some mistake.
PHILIP MALLOY: That’s the way she is.
MR. MALLOY: You have to stick up for yourself. That’s all there is to it. Phil, do what you feel is right. We’ll stand
behind you.
MRS. MALLOY: It’s so hard to believe.
PHILIP MALLOY: She’s really nuts.
MR. MALLOY: Must be.
9:45 P.M.
From a Letter Written by Margaret Narwin to Her Sister, Anita Wigham
… So you see, Anita, it was gratifying to hear Gertrude talk this way to me, exactly the kind of support teachers
need. Certainly it’s what I need at this time. I can’t tell you how much. It bucks me up.
Many teachers have almost nothing good to say about their administrators, complaining that they fail to support
them, much less grasp the complexities of the classroom situation, or that they show only slight concern about their
problems. My principal is different.
I’m lucky….
11:05 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Lots of kids bad-mouth their parents, say they never stick up for them or understand them. Or pay any attention to
them. Stuff like that. My parents are different.
I’m lucky.
8:05 A.M.
Discussion in Margaret Narwin’s Homeroom Class
INTERCOM VOICE OF DR. GERTRUDE DOANE, HARRISON HIGH PRINCIPAL: Good morning to all students, faculty, and
staff. Today is Friday, March 30. Today will be a Schedule B day.
Today in history: in 1746 on this date was the birth of Francisco José de Goya. In 1853 on this date
Vincent van Gogh was born. In 1981, on this date, was the attempted assassination of President Ronald
Reagan.
Please all rise and stand at respectful, silent attention for the playing of our national anthem.
Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light …
MISS NARWIN: Philip, is that you singing again?
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight …
MISS NARWIN: Philip! I am talking to you!
PHILIP MALLOY: I have the right to do it.
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air …
MISS NARWIN: The what?
PHILIP MALLOY: The right.
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there….
MISS NARWIN: I want you to stop it immediately. Your actions are thoroughly disrespectful.
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s you who’s being disrespectful!
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave …
MISS NARWIN: Philip!
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
PHILIP MALLOY: I was being patriotic. That’s all. It’s a free country. You have no right to stop me. I was just
singing to myself.
MISS NARWIN: Philip Malloy, you will leave this room immediately! Report to the principal’s office.
PHILIP MALLOY: You can’t keep me from being patriotic.
MISS NARWIN: Leave!
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m going. I’m going.
8:42 A.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Dr. Joseph Palleni, Assistant Principal, Harrison High
DR. PALLENI: Okay, Philip, you can come into the office. Go on, sit down. Didn’t I just see you yesterday?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
DR. PALLENI: Something with you and Miss Narwin?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
DR. PALLENI: What’s happened now?
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing.
DR. PALLENI: Come on, Phil. Of course it’s something. It may be unimportant. Or important. But it’s something.
Come on, look up at me. You can talk. Now, what’s happening? What’s going on?
PHILIP MALLOY: Miss Narwin …
DR. PALLENI: Go on.
PHILIP MALLOY: She won’t let me sing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
DR. PALLENI: Isn’t this what we were talking about the last time?
PHILIP MALLOY: She’s against me being patriotic.
DR. PALLENI: I thought we agreed that when we have rules in schools, we stick with them. Didn’t we agree to that?
PHILIP MALLOY: How can she keep me from singing the national anthem?
DR. PALLENI: Philip …
PHILIP MALLOY: Get me out of her classes.
DR. PALLENI: Look, Philip, what do you want me to do? Change the rules just for you? Do you?
PHILIP MALLOY: No, but …
DR. PALLENI: I had a real fistfight out there. Todd Becker. Arnie Lieber? You know them?
PHILIP MALLOY: Sort of.
DR. PALLENI: Serious fight. Todd took a licking. Ugly. Now, you come in here … Look, I’ll be straight with you.
This is your second time this week. Talk about rules, you’re talking suspension. What do you say, Phil, you get
up, go back there, and apologize? To Miss Narwin. Say you’ll follow rules. Then, as far as I’m concerned, we
forget it. Nothing on your record. What do you say?
PHILIP MALLOY: I was just singing….
DR. PALLENI: Did you hear me?
PHILIP MALLOY: She’s wrong. That’s all. She’s wrong. No way I’m apologizing.
DR. PALLENI: That’s all you have to say?
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s a free country.
DR. PALLENI: Nothing is free.
PHILIP MALLOY: Get me out of her classes.
DR. PALLENI: Phil, go sit out there for a while. Cool off. If you want to change your mind about this, tell Miss Mack
out front you want to see me again. Otherwise—just so you understand—I check with Miss Narwin, and if she
confirms what you said—that you were breaking rules—hey, I call your folks, they come get you—boom!—
two-day suspension. Get it? Automatic.
PHILIP MALLOY: But she’s wrong.
DR. PALLENI: Philip, I’ll level with you. You’re the one who is wrong. You’re here to get an education. Rules are
rules. Now clear out. I’ve got important business here. Go on. Speak to Miss Mack out there if you change your
mind.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m not going to change my mind. We don’t get along. Get me out of her classes.
DR. PALLENI: Philip, out!
9:30 A.M.
Conversation between Dr. Joseph Palleni and Margaret Narwin
DR. PALLENI: Excuse me, Miss Narwin, may I have a word with you?
MISS NARWIN: Class, just continue on with reading that scene. I’ll be right outside.
DR. PALLENI: Sorry to bother you, Peg. Look, it’s about this Phil Malloy.
MISS NARWIN: Something is certainly bothering that boy.
DR. PALLENI: Singing when you asked him not to.
MISS NARWIN: Quite provocative. Trying to create an incident.
DR. PALLENI: Any idea what it’s about?
MISS NARWIN: No.
DR. PALLENI: I offered to get him out of this business by coming back and apologizing, but he won’t. Two-day
suspension.
MISS NARWIN: Maybe it would be better to switch him into another homeroom.
DR. PALLENI: That’s what he suggested. And out of your English class too.
MISS NARWIN: He’s been doing poorly there.
DR. PALLENI: Maybe that’s it.
MISS NARWIN: I think he’s lazy.
DR. PALLENI: Let’s start with a homeroom change.
MISS NARWIN: He seems to get on with Bernie Lunser.
DR. PALLENI: Good idea.
MISS NARWIN: Suspension might be counterproductive.
DR. PALLENI: I hear you. Won’t keep you. The parents might want to talk to you.
MISS NARWIN: I understand. I wish I could reach him. I just don’t seem to. Really, a nice boy.
DR. PALLENI: Yeah. Good kid. Maybe something going on at home. Or hormones. Have a girlfriend?
MISS NARWIN:Joe, I wouldn’t know.
DR. PALLENI: Okay, Peg. Sorry to bother you.
MISS NARWIN: Let me know if I can be of further help.
DR. PALLENI: Catch you later.
9:52 A.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Dr. Joseph Palleni
DR. PALLENI: Now, Philip, I checked with Miss Narwin, and she is in agreement with you. You did break the rules.
She also made a point of saying she was prepared to let bygones be bygones if you do as I suggested, apologize
and promise not to do that again.
PHILIP MALLOY: No.
DR. PALLENI: Hey, come on, Phil, it’ll be a shame to put something down on your record. It’s a perfectly good one.
PHILIP MALLOY: No.
DR. PALLENI: Then, Phil, I’m prepared to call one of your parents to come get you and take you home. You’ll be out
for the rest of the day and … I could make it Monday and Tuesday, but … How about just Monday? Give you a
long weekend to think it out.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m not going to change my mind.
DR. PALLENI: Okay, who do you want me to call? Your mother or your father?
PHILIP MALLOY: My father doesn’t like to be called at work.
DR. PALLENI: Too bad. Is your mother reachable? I can’t read a shrug.
PHILIP MALLOY: She works too.
DR. PALLENI: Where?
PHILIP MALLOY: At the phone company.
DR. PALLENI: I guess we can reach her. I’ll call her. Last chance, Phil.
PHILIP MALLOY: Can’t you just change—
DR. PALLENI: First things first. An apology.
PHILIP MALLOY: Call her.
9:59 A.M.
Phone Conversation between Dr. Joseph Palleni and Mrs. Malloy
DR. PALLENI: Hello? Is this Mrs. Malloy? Phil’s mother?
MRS. MALLOY: Yes, it is.
DR. PALLENI: This is Dr. Palleni, assistant principal at Harrison High.
MRS. MALLOY: Is something the matter with Philip?
DR. PALLENI: Well, no, not exactly. He’s sitting right here in front of me. In perfect health. Mrs. Malloy, I’m afraid
we’ve had a little incident here—rule-breaking.
MRS. MALLOY: What happened?
DR. PALLENI: And breaking a rule twice in one week after he’d been warned once.
MRS. MALLOY: What rule?
DR. PALLENI: In fact, Philip was offered—I just offered it—a chance to apologize to the teacher in question, but he
won’t take it. So, I’m afraid—let me stress this is Phil’s decision, not mine—what we have here is a two-day
suspension situation. I’m afraid you’ll have to come and take him home.
MRS. MALLOY: Now?
DR. PALLENI: Yes, now.
MRS. MALLOY: I’m at my job.
DR. PALLENI: I am sorry. You will have to come.
MRS. MALLOY: What rule did he break?
DR. PALLENI: We can talk about it when you get here. I’d rather we all—you, me, and Philip—talk about it together.
MRS. MALLOY: I have to get permission.
DR. PALLENI: I understand.
MRS. MALLOY: I’ll come over.
DR. PALLENI: Thank you.
10:04 A.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Dr. Joseph Palleni
PHILIP MALLOY: She coming?
DR. PALLENI: Did you think she wouldn’t? Philip, you’re bringing a bunch of grief to yourself. And a bother to her.
Now, last chance—apologize?
PHILIP MALLOY: No.
DR. PALLENI: Go wait out there until your mother comes.
10:05 A.M.
Phone Conversation between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MR. MALLOY: Susan, I wish you wouldn’t call me like this. It’s very tense around here today.
MRS. MALLOY: I had to speak to you. I just got a call from Phil’s school.
MR. MALLOY: Something the matter? What’s up?
MRS. MALLOY: They’re going to suspend him.
MR. MALLOY: Phil?
MRS. MALLOY: It was the principal. I have to go in and get him. He’s suspended.
MR. MALLOY: Why?
MRS. MALLOY: Some rule.
MR. MALLOY: What rule? Didn’t you ask?
MRS. MALLOY: They wouldn’t tell me.
MR. MALLOY: They can’t just …
MRS. MALLOY: I’m really upset.
MR. MALLOY: What it is, is they’re really after the kid.
MRS. MALLOY: I don’t know….
MR. MALLOY: I’m going to give them a piece of my mind.
MRS. MALLOY: Don’t you think we should—
MR. MALLOY: Susan, the kid has done nothing!
MRS. MALLOY: We can speak—
MR. MALLOY: Honey, I have to go. Something just came up.
10:10 A.M.
TO: PHILIP MALLOY
FROM: DR. JOSEPH PALLENI, ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL
RE: NEW HOMEROOM ASSIGNMENTS FOR SPRING TERM
Dear Philip ,
As we head into the Spring term, the faculty committee has made some changes in homeroom assignments. This
will facilitate the movements of students, as well as allow for a greater degree of freedom in the planning of
Spring term extracurricular schedules.
Your new homeroom teacher is: Mr. Lunser , in room: 304 . Effective Tuesday, April 3, 8 A.M.
Thank you for your cooperation.
DR. JOSEPH PALLENI
Assistant Principal
10:42 A.M.
Conversation among Philip Malloy, Mrs. Malloy, and Dr. Joseph Palleni
DR. PALLENI: Okay, this is what we’ve got here. Philip broke a rule. Twice. He and I talked it over earlier this
week. I made it clear what would happen. We try to be flexible, but we still have rules. Everybody has to work
together. Cooperation. If a student creates a disturbance in a classroom, that’s breaking a rule. An important
rule. Students cannot break—cannot make a disturbance in a classroom. Straightforward rule infraction. Now,
we offered Philip here a chance—he has a perfectly clean record—an opportunity to apologize to the teacher
in question. I’ll offer it again. Will you do that, Phil, apologize, so we can just end all this?
PHILIP MALLOY: She really dislikes me.
DR. PALLENI: Who is that?
PHILIP MALLOY: Narwin.
MRS. MALLOY: Philip has been saying that—
DR. PALLENI: Look, Mrs. Malloy, I don’t want to get into that. Philip admits he broke a rule.
MRS. MALLOY: What rule?
DR. PALLENI: Disturbing a class.
PHILIP MALLOY: Singing the national anthem.
MRS. MALLOY: Is that the rule?
DR. PALLENI: Yes, disturbing the class.
MRS. MALLOY: I just can’t believe that—
DR. PALLENI: Excuse me. Philip, did you break the rule?
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s a dumb rule.
DR. PALLENI: See? He’s admitting it. Mrs. Malloy, it is my job—one of my jobs—to make sure the school—the
kids, the staff, the teachers—works together in harmony. I’m sure we agree that we can’t have kids deciding
which rules to follow and which rules not to follow. I really don’t wish to discuss it. Two-day suspension. For
the rest of today. And Monday. Be back on Tuesday.
MRS. MALLOY: I just want to say I don’t think it’s right. I mean, singing the—
DR. PALLENI: Excuse me. Are you saying that kids should only follow the rules they want to?
MRS. MALLOY: No, but—
DR. PALLENI: Then we’re in agreement. Thank you for coming in. Philip, I hope you think about it.
11:02 A. M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and His Mother on Their Way Home
MRS. MALLOY: Phil, what is this all about?
PHILIP MALLOY: I told you, that teacher …
MRS. MALLOY: You’ve never been suspended.
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s her.
MRS. MALLOY: But why?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know.
MRS. MALLOY: They said you could apologize.
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing to apologize about.
MRS. MALLOY: Your father is going to be very upset.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah, well, he told me I should stick up for myself. Said I shouldn’t let her push me around. That
she was wrong and I was right. So I did.
MRS. MALLOY: When did he say that?
PHILIP MALLOY: Last night. Said I should do what was right.
MRS. MALLOY: Mr.—What’s his name?
PHILIP MALLOY: Palleni.
MRS. MALLOY: —said you were creating a disturbance.
PHILIP MALLOY: Bull. It’s all her fault.
MRS. MALLOY: Who?
PHILIP MALLOY: Narwin!
MRS. MALLOY: We’ll talk it out with your father when he gets home tonight.
PHILIP MALLOY: No way I’m going back to her class again.
MRS. MALLOY: Sometimes I think we should have sent you to Washington Academy.
PHILIP MALLOY: Geeky private school? No way.
MRS. MALLOY: We’ll talk. I just want you to know I’m very upset.
PHILIP MALLOY: Sorry.
11:15 A.M.
TO: MARGARET NARWIN
FROM: DR. JOSEPH PALLENI, ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL
RE: PHILIP MALLOY
Philip Malloy has been suspended for two days—effective today—for causing a disturbance in your homeroom
class. I also transferred him back to Mr. Lunser for homeroom.
11:16 A.M.
TO: BERNARD LUNSER
FROM: DR. JOSEPH PALLENI, ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL
RE: PHILIP MALLOY
Philip Malloy will be returning to you as his homeroom teacher effective April 3. He has been suspended for
two days—effective today—for causing a disturbance in Miss Narwin’s class. While what is involved here is
only a minor infraction, more acting out than anything else, there may be some personal problems with the boy (at
home?), so I would appreciate hearing from you as to Philip’s behavior in your class. I should like to be helpful to
him.
11:26 A.M.
TO: DR. GERTRUDE DOANE, PRINCIPAL
FROM: DR. JOSEPH PALLENI, ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, HARRISON HIGH SCHOOL
RE: PHILIP MALLOY
Philip Malloy (ninth grade) has been suspended for two days—effective today—for causing a disturbance in
Miss Narwin’s homeroom class. Because I feel that the problem may have arisen out of some obscure tension
between teacher and student, I decided it was advisable to transfer the boy to Mr. Lunser’s homeroom.
Since I assume nothing more will come of this, I’m not aware of anything here that requires your further
attention.
12:46 P.M.
Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Dr. Joseph Palleni
DR. PALLENI: Oh, Peg! I know you’re rushing off. Look, just want you to know I took care of the Malloy boy. Talked
to his mother. She understands. Couple of days’ suspension. No big deal.
MISS NARWIN: Did you have to suspend him?
DR. PALLENI: The rule. Two infractions in one week. Anyway, I put a memo in your box. Also, switched him back
to Bernie for homeroom. What about his English class?
MISS NARWIN: I don’t want to give up on him yet.
DR. PALLENI: Whatever you say.
MISS NARWIN: He’s really a nice boy. Thanks for taking care of it.
DR. PALLENI: No problem.
MISS NARWIN: I have a class….
DR. PALLENI: Have a good one.
3:45 P.M.
Phone Conversation between Philip Malloy and Ken Barchet
KEN BARCHET: Hey, Phil, what’s happening?
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing. Going out to deliver my papers.
KEN BARCHET: I heard you got suspended.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
KEN BARCHET: For how long?
PHILIP MALLOY: Couple of days.
KEN BARCHET: What for?
PHILIP MALLOY: You were there.
KEN BARCHET: Because of your singing?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
KEN BARCHET: I thought that was funny. Too cool.
PHILIP MALLOY: Wasn’t loud.
KEN BARCHET: I heard it. She’d like to throw a fit.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
KEN BARCHET: I mean, far-out. What made you do it?
PHILIP MALLOY: Free country.
KEN BARCHET: Not as if you have a good voice. People were cracking up.
PHILIP MALLOY: I know. Was Allison laughing?
KEN BARCHET: I don’t know. We going to work out after your deliveries?
PHILIP MALLOY: Sure.
KEN BARCHET: See you at the park.
3:48 P.M.
Phone Conversation between Philip Malloy and Allison Doresett
ALLISON DORESETT: Is this Phil?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
ALLISON DORESETT: This is Allison.
PHILIP MALLOY: Oh, hi.
ALLISON DORESETT: Is it true that you got suspended?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.
ALLISON DORESETT: Why?
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing. You were there.
ALLISON DORESETT: The singing?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
ALLISON DORESETT: That?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. Narwin got me kicked out.
ALLISON DORESETT: You’re kidding. She wouldn’t do that.
PHILIP MALLOY: She did. You saw it.
ALLISON DORESETT: No, I mean, she’s nice.
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t think so.
ALLISON DORESETT: For how long?
PHILIP MALLOY: Two days.
ALLISON DORESETT: Wow. You must have really got on her nerves.
PHILIP MALLOY:Just singing … humming.
ALLISON DORESETT: Well, I just wanted to know. People were talking.
PHILIP MALLOY: What were they saying?
ALLISON DORESETT: You know. How weird. See you.
PHILIP MALLOY: See you.
5:30 P.M.
From a Letter Written by Margaret Narwin to Her Sister, Anita Wigham
… So you see, Anita, what intrigues me about this new concept of teaching English—Whole Language—is that it
has its focus on literature, and in a way that I think young people will find very interesting. Still, I can hear you
say, “It’s just another education fad.”
You may be right. But if the truth be known, Anita, teaching is exhausting. And what I say is this: if it takes a
“fad” to pump energy back into the classroom, why, it’s worth it just for that!
Sorry to have gone on so long about this. It’s just caught my fancy. I can hardly think about anything else.
Oh, yes, do you remember my writing to you about a student I have, Philip Malloy? I’m convinced now that
there is something going on in this boy’s private life that is deeply troubling to him. Twice this week I had to send
him out for being disruptive in a singularly disrespectful way. Our society is always asking schools to do what is
not done at home. Then Joe Palleni (assistant principal) felt compelled to suspend him for a bit, something I never
believe is productive. I told him that too. In fact, Philip is a nice boy. So I do feel badly about the whole thing. I
always do when I lose a student. Next week—when he comes back—I intend to sit down with him and have a
heart-to-heart talk.
This weekend I’ll be visiting with Barbara Benthave. She and her husband …
6:45 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MRS. MALLOY: Oh, hi, honey.
MR. MALLOY: Where’s Philip?
MRS. MALLOY: Up in the shower. Just got back from running.
MR. MALLOY: You talk to him about what happened?
MRS. MALLOY: When I drove him home. But I had to get right back to work. It’s just what I told you. How was your
day?
MR. MALLOY: Rotten. Dexter is still sore at me.
MRS. MALLOY: Get yourself a drink to settle down first. We have plenty of time to talk over dinner.
MR. MALLOY: Sure.
7:12 P.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy and His Parents During Dinner
MR. MALLOY: Okay, Phil. Now, I want to hear the whole thing. Start to finish. Just understand, right from the start,
we’re on your side. We don’t intend to just take it. But I have to know what happened. Go on now.
PHILIP MALLOY: Same as before.
MR. MALLOY: Same as what before?
MRS. MALLOY: He’s trying to tell you, dear.
PHILIP MALLOY: See, they play “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the beginning of school….
MR. MALLOY: I understand. When I was a kid we pledged allegiance. Go on.
PHILIP MALLOY: A tape.
MR. MALLOY: Okay.
PHILIP MALLOY: When—before—when I was in Mr. Lunser’s class, he was like, almost asking me to sing out loud.
MRS. MALLOY: I always thought Philip had a good voice.
MR. MALLOY: That’s not exactly relevant! Go on.
PHILIP MALLOY: But this teacher—
MR. MALLOY: Mrs. Narwin.
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s Miss.
MR. MALLOY: Figures.
MRS. MALLOY: That has nothing to do with it, Ben!
MR. MALLOY: Go on.
PHILIP MALLOY: She won’t let me. Threw me out of class.
MRS. MALLOY: The principal said it was a rule.
PHILIP MALLOY: Ma, he’s the assistant principal.
MR. MALLOY: But why does that mean suspension?
PHILIP MALLOY: She threw me out twice this week.
MR. MALLOY: It seems arbitrary. Outrageous.
MRS. MALLOY: Stupid rules.
MR. MALLOY: Right. How can you have a rule against singing “The Star-Spangled Banner”?
PHILIP MALLOY: Ask Narwin.
MR. MALLOY: You know who I bet would be interested in this?
PHILIP MALLOY: Who?
MR. MALLOY: Ted Griffen.
MRS. MALLOY: Why?
MR. MALLOY: He’s a neighbor. A friend. And he’s running for school board. He should be interested. That’s what
the board does. Keeps the schools in line.
PHILIP MALLOY: He won’t be able to do anything. If I could just get out of her classes.
MR. MALLOY: Maybe. Maybe not. Phil, we intend to support you on this.
8:40 P.M.
Conversation among Philip Malloy, Mr. Malloy, and Ted Griffen
PHILIP MALLOY: Dad, I don’t think he’ll be interested.
MR. MALLOY: Of course he will. Now, just let me do the talking. Ted! Hello.
MR. GRIFFEN: Oh, Ben. Hello. Is that you, Philip? How you guys doing?
MR. MALLOY: Ted, got a minute? This a bad time?
MR. GRIFFEN: Well, I am in the middle of a talk with—why, what’s up?
MR. MALLOY: Something about school. And Phil here….
MR. GRIFFEN: I’m not on the school board yet, Ben. Trying, but not yet.
MR. MALLOY: That’s the point. This is something that happened to Phil at school.
MR. GRIFFEN: I don’t know if I should …
MR. MALLOY: He was suspended for singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
MR. GRIFFEN: What?
MR. MALLOY: You heard me. Phil was kicked out of school for singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
MR. GRIFFEN: Are you serious?
MR. MALLOY: I know. It’s crazy. Today.
MR. GRIFFEN: That true?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yes, sir.
MR. GRIFFEN: Singing?
MR. MALLOY: We couldn’t believe it at first either. But they called Susan at work, mind you. Made her leave work
and bring him home. Two-day suspension. For singing.
MR. GRIFFEN: Who did it?
MR. MALLOY: The principal.
PHILIP MALLOY: Assistant principal.
MR. GRIFFEN: When were you singing?
MR. MALLOY: Tell him.
PHILIP MALLOY: They sing, play the … the national anthem in the morning. And I, like—I was singing it. Mostly to
myself. Then, I have this teacher—people don’t like her—and she, well, she threw me out of the class and—
MR. GRIFFEN: Wait a minute. I want to get this straight. Look, I have this reporter I’m talking to. Jennifer Stewart.
From the Manchester Record. School beat. How about talking to me with her there?
MR. MALLOY: What do you say?
PHILIP MALLOY: A reporter?
MR. GRIFFEN: She does their educational stuff. She’s covering school board elections around the state. A good
person.
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know….
MR. GRIFFEN: Nothing to worry about. Very straightforward. I’d like her to hear about this. Really, I would. Just tell
her the truth. You don’t mind, do you, Ben?
MR. MALLOY: No.
MR. GRIFFEN: Phil?
PHILIP MALLOY: Well …
MR. GRIFFEN: Sure. Just tell her the truth. Come on in.
8:45 P.M.
Conversation among Philip Malloy, Mr. Malloy, Ted Griffen, and Jennifer Stewart, Education Reporter from
the Manchester Record
MR. GRIFFEN: Jennifer, this is my neighbor from across the street, Ben Malloy. His son, Phil Malloy. Jennifer
Stewart, from the Manchester Record.
MS. STEWART: Pleased to meet you.
MR. MALLOY: Evening.
MR. GRIFFEN: Jennifer was just interviewing me for a piece she’s doing on the school board elections. Statewide.
These guys think I’m such a shoo-in to be elected they’re already bringing me problems.
MS. STEWART: Shows a lot of confidence in you.
MR. GRIFFEN: Actually, people are tired of the old ways. Not happy with the way things are. Now, for example, this
thing, these guys, Phil here, tells me something that’s outrageous. Something I would never condone.
MS. STEWART: What’s that?
MR. MALLOY: Phil, tell her what you told Ted.
MS. STEWART: This something … Is it Philip?
MR. MALLOY: Yes. Philip. M–a–l–l–o–y.
MS. STEWART: This something that happened to you?
MR. GRIFFEN: He lives right across the street. Neighbors. Old—and good—friends.
MR. MALLOY: Phil, tell her what happened. Exactly as it was. This was just today.
MS. STEWART: Philip?
PHILIP MALLOY: Well, see, there’s this teacher.
MR. MALLOY: Go on.
PHILIP MALLOY: Miss Narwin, English teacher, and she doesn’t like me….
MR. GRIFFEN: No. Tell her what you told me.
MR. MALLOY: This is part of it.
MS. STEWART: Tell it your own way, Philip.
PHILIP MALLOY: In the mornings, at school, in homeroom, before morning announcements, they play “The StarSpangled Banner.”
MS. STEWART: Who plays?
PHILIP MALLOY: The school. On the sound system.
MS. STEWART:Just want to get this down. Okay. Go on.
PHILIP MALLOY: And, I like to sing along.
MR. MALLOY: It’s the way we’ve brought him up.
MR. GRIFFEN: The whole neighborhood is like that.
MS. STEWART: Go on, Philip.
PHILIP MALLOY: And this teacher …
MS. STEWART: Could you spell her name?
PHILIP MALLOY: Miss Narwin.
MR. MALLOY: M–a–r–w–i–n. She’s always on the boy’s back. Bad teacher. The kids don’t like her.
MR. GRIFFEN: Narwin? Or Marwin?
MR. MALLOY: Right.
MS. STEWART: Go on, Philip.
PHILIP MALLOY: Well, I like to, you know, sing along. But, see, she kicked me out. For singing it.
MS. STEWART: The national anthem?
MR. GRIFFEN: Hard to believe.
MR. MALLOY: It’s true. The principal even admitted it to my wife.
PHILIP MALLOY: Assistant principal.
MR. MALLOY: Well, anyway, they admit it.
MS. STEWART: Is there more?
PHILIP MALLOY: It happened again.
MS. STEWART: Twice?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. Three times, actually.
MS. STEWART: And?
PHILIP MALLOY: They suspended me.
MR. GRIFFEN: How anyone could get kicked out of school for …
MR. MALLOY: Being patriotic.
MR. GRIFFEN: If I were on the board, I wouldn’t accept this. I would not condone this. No way.
MS. STEWART: Philip, was anyone else kicked out?
PHILIP MALLOY:Just me.
MS. STEWART: Do you have any sense as to why you in particular?
PHILIP MALLOY: They have a rule against it.
MS. STEWART: Rule against what?
MR. MALLOY: Singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
MR. GRIFFEN: Absurd!
MS. STEWART: And this is something I can check out?
PHILIP MALLOY: I guess. Sure. Go on.
MR. MALLOY: The principal admitted it.
MR. GRIFFEN: Jennifer, and you can quote me on this, I don’t intend to be silent about this issue. This is a school, an
American school, and parents have a right to expect that certain things, like values, will be taught. Community
values. Things I believe in. I mean that. Sincerely.
11:34 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
It really hit the fan today. So much happened I have a headache. It’s going to take a while to think out. Actually, I
don’t feel so great. In a way, the whole thing is stupid. But everybody says I was right. And I was.

Phone Conversation between Jennifer Stewart of the Manchester Record and Dr. Albert Seymour, Harrison
School Superintendent
MS. STEWART: May I speak to Dr. Albert Seymour, please.
DR. SEYMOUR: Speaking.
MS. STEWART: Dr. Seymour, this is Jennifer Stewart of the Manchester Record.
DR. SEYMOUR: How do you do?
MS. STEWART: I hope you don’t mind a call at home. I’m the education reporter.
DR. SEYMOUR: Oh, yes.
MS. STEWART: Something has come up—a report, sir—and I wanted to check some facts with you.
DR. SEYMOUR: If I can be helpful … certainly.
MS. STEWART: Sir, does the Harrison School District have a rule that forbids students from singing “The StarSpangled Banner”?
DR. SEYMOUR: Beg pardon?
MS. STEWART: Yes, sir. Does the Harrison School District have a rule that students are not allowed to sing “The
Star-Spangled Banner”?
DR. SEYMOUR: Of course not. Whatever gave you that idea? Who told you that?
MS. STEWART: There’s been a claim …
DR. SEYMOUR: Hogwash. You should check your sources.
MS. STEWART: I’m checking them right now.
DR. SEYMOUR: The answer is no. We do not have such a rule. Absolutely.
MS. STEWART: May I quote you?
DR. SEYMOUR: Of course.
MS. STEWART: Thank you.
DR. SEYMOUR: You’re quite welcome.
10:15 A.M.
Phone Conversation between Jennifer Stewart of the Manchester Record and Dr. Gertrude Doane, Principal,
Harrison High
MS. STEWART: May I speak to Dr. Doane, please.
DR. DOANE: This is she.
MS. STEWART: Dr. Doane, my name is Jennifer Stewart, of the Manchester Record. I do the school stories. Sorry to
bother you on a Saturday….
DR. DOANE: Yes?
MS. STEWART: I’m checking out an item that’s come to our attention. It would appear that one of your students,
Philip Malloy—
DR. DOANE: Ninth grade.
MS. STEWART: You know him?
DR. DOANE: Oh, yes. Nice boy. Know him well. Has something happened to him?
MS. STEWART: This is in reference to his suspension from school.
DR. DOANE: Suspension?
MS. STEWART: Isn’t that something—a suspension—that as principal you would know something about?
DR. DOANE: Well, yes….
MS. STEWART: On Friday, March 30, yesterday, Philip Malloy—he claims, as his parents claim, that he was
suspended from your high school for two days.
DR. DOANE: Discipline problems are usually in the hands of my assistant principal, Dr. Palleni. In any case I was at
meetings all—
MS. STEWART: Wouldn’t Dr. Palleni discuss such a suspension with you first?
DR. DOANE: That would depend on … Ms….
MS. STEWART: Stewart.
DR. DOANE: Ms. Stewart, actually I’m not sure I should be discussing this matter with you. Records regarding our
children are of a confidential nature.
MS. STEWART: It’s already a matter of public record. The boy—and his father—have made a public statement. They
claim he was suspended.
DR. DOANE: That’s what you say.
MS. STEWART: Dr. Doane, if you don’t wish to cooperate …
DR. DOANE: Now just one moment, Ms….
MS. STEWART: Stewart.
DR. DOANE: Ms. Stewart, you call me up and inform me about something of which I have had no prior
information….
MS. STEWART: Then you didn’t know about this?
DR. DOANE: I just said—
MS. STEWART: Ms. Doane—
DR. DOANE: Dr. Doane.
MS. STEWART: Excuse me. Dr. Doane, Philip Malloy, who is a student at your school, and who you claim to know
well, has made a statement to the effect that he was suspended for singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
DR. DOANE: Oh, really!
MS. STEWART: His father claims this is true. Now, I just spoke to your superintendent….
DR. DOANE: Dr. Seymour?
MS. STEWART: That’s right. And he says that the Harrison School District has no such rule. So, I am just trying to
sort this out….
DR. DOANE: I don’t know the particulars of this situation. You’ve only just informed me about it. I see no reason to
be talking to a reporter about a student’s problem. In any case, it doesn’t seem to have happened. The
superintendent told you we have no such rule.
MS. STEWART: Would a student in your school run into difficulty by singing the national anthem?
DR. DOANE: Of course not. But I repeat: discipline problems of a minor nature are handled by my assistant
principal.
MS. STEWART: Palleni?
DR. DOANE: That’s right. Dr. Joseph Palleni.
MS. STEWART: Thank you.
10:30 A.M.
Discussion between Philip Malloy and His Mother
PHILIP MALLOY: Hey, Ma, look! Look at this letter.
MRS. MALLOY: What letter?
PHILIP MALLOY:Just came in the mail. Look. They shifted me out of Narwin’s homeroom class. Back to Mr. Lunser.
MRS. MALLOY: Let me see. Well, that’s something. They must have seen something was wrong there. Maybe you can
go back to school Monday.
PHILIP MALLOY: Says it won’t happen till Tuesday. When I go back.
MRS. MALLOY: May be just as well. I don’t want you to have to deal with that woman again.
PHILIP MALLOY: But I still have her for English.
MRS. MALLOY: Didn’t they change that?
PHILIP MALLOY: No.
MRS. MALLOY: But if they admit they’re wrong about the one thing …
PHILIP MALLOY: Bet they just forgot to say that. Where’s Dad?
MRS. MALLOY: Went to the store. Feel better?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. But the English …
MRS. MALLOY: You just said they forgot.
PHILIP MALLOY: I guess….

Phone Conversation between Jennifer Stewart of the Manchester Record and Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Palleni
MS. STEWART: May I speak to Dr. Joseph Palleni, please?
MRS. PALLENI: Who’s calling, please?
MS. STEWART:Jennifer Stewart, reporter for the Manchester Record.
MRS. PALLENI: He’s in the backyard. I’ll get him.
MS. STEWART: Appreciate that.
DR. PALLENI: Hello? This is Dr. Palleni.
MS. STEWART: Dr. Palleni, this is Jennifer Stewart. I’m a reporter for the Manchester Record. I’m doing a story—
I’ve already spoken with your superintendent, Dr. Seymour, and your principal, Dr. Doane—
DR. PALLENI: What is this about?
MS. STEWART: Dr. Palleni, according to Dr. Seymour, the Harrison School District has no rule that would keep a
student from singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
DR. PALLENI: Did you say singing?
MS. STEWART: Yes. Is that your understanding?
DR. PALLENI: Well …
MS. STEWART: Now your principal, Dr. Doane, says that you are in charge of discipline in the school.
DR. PALLENI: With her.
MS. STEWART: With her?
DR. PALLENI: I always keep her informed.
MS. STEWART: Did you inform her that on Friday you suspended a student, Philip Malloy, for singing “The Star-
Spangled Banner”?
DR. PALLENI: I did no such thing!
MS. STEWART: You didn’t inform your superior, or you didn’t suspend the boy for singing “The Star-Spangled
Banner”? Which? I am simply trying to get my facts straight. Dr. Palleni? Are you still there?
DR. PALLENI: I don’t wish to talk to you.
MS. STEWART: No comment?
DR. PALLENI: No comment. But you’ve got your facts all wrong.
MS. STEWART: Is that your comment?
DR. PALLENI: No comment.
MS. STEWART: I’m sorry. Should I call you back?
DR. PALLENI: Not to talk about this.
MS. STEWART: May I quote you?
DR. PALLENI: Thank you. Good-bye.
11:00 A.M.
Phone Conversation between Jennifer Stewart of the Manchester Record and Margaret Narwin
MS. STEWART: Margaret Narwin, please.
MISS NARWIN: Speaking.
MS. STEWART: Miss Narwin, my name is Jennifer Stewart, of the Manchester Record. The education reporter. I’m
trying to write a story regarding an incident—something that appears to have happened in your school, in your
class. I understand you are a teacher.
MISS NARWIN: An English teacher. In the high school.
MS. STEWART: How long have you taught there?
MISS NARWIN: For twenty-one years. What incident are you referring to? I’m not aware …
MS. STEWART: I’m simply trying to get the facts correct. Wanting to be fair to all concerned. I’m sure you can
appreciate that.
MISS NARWIN: Are you sure this has something to do with me?
MS. STEWART: That appears to be the case. And, as I say, I want to be fair to all concerned, and report the facts
correctly.
MISS NARWIN: I’m afraid I don’t understand….
MS. STEWART: I spoke to your superintendent, your principal, and your assistant principal, as well as Philip Malloy
and his father.
MISS NARWIN: Who?
MS. STEWART: Philip Malloy. I believe he is one of your students.
MISS NARWIN: Well …
MS. STEWART: Now, as I understand it, the boy was dismissed from your class, then suspended from school because
—he says it’s a question of patriotism with him—he sang “The Star-Spangled Banner” during opening
exercises in school in your class. Could you shed some light on this? Miss Narwin? Are you there?
MISS NARWIN: Yes….
MS. STEWART: Could you give me your side of the story?
MISS NARWIN: The boy was creating a disturbance.
MS. STEWART: I’m sorry. I couldn’t hear you. Could you speak up?
MISS NARWIN: The boy was creating a serious disturbance.
MS. STEWART: By singing the national anthem?
MISS NARWIN: We have a rule….
MS. STEWART: Your superintendent, Dr. Seymour, says there is no rule.
MISS NARWIN: I don’t think I should be talking about this.
MS. STEWART: But you do acknowledge that you sent him from your room?
MISS NARWIN: Yes, but …
MS. STEWART: For singing our national anthem?
MISS NARWIN: I think you need to speak to our principal.
MS. STEWART: I did speak to her.
MISS NARWIN: Then I have nothing more to say.
MS. STEWART: You are sure?
MISS NARWIN: Quite sure.
MS. STEWART: Thank you, Miss … or is it Mrs. Narwin?
MISS NARWIN: Miss.
MS. STEWART: Thank you.
MISS NARWIN: Thank you.

Phone Conversation between Dr. Gertrude Doane and Dr. Joseph Palleni
DR. DOANE:Joe, sorry to bother you at home.
DR. PALLENI: That’s all right….
DR. DOANE: I just got a call from a newspaper reporter—Manchester Record—
DR. PALLENI: Oh, right. She called me.
DR. DOANE: She did?
DR. PALLENI: About a suspension—Philip Malloy. On Friday.
DR. DOANE: What is this? I was at district meetings. What’s this all about? Why should a reporter be calling?
DR. PALLENI: I put a memo in your box. Yesterday.
DR. DOANE:Joe, I was at meetings.
DR. PALLENI: Right. I know. Okay. The Malloy boy was suspended for two days—actually, less—because he was
causing a disturbance in Peg Narwin’s class.
DR. DOANE: Joe, what this reporter said—told me—it was for singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.” What’s this all
about?
DR. PALLENI: Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. It was just that he—Philip—was acting out in class. Look, Gert, he did
it twice this week. So I had to suspend him. Look. I, you know, I talked it over with the kid. He agrees about
what happened. He does. That’s not an issue. Besides, I gave him a chance to work it out, you know, apologize,
promise not to do it again. He’s okay. I mean, his record is perfect. Didn’t seem like much of a thing. But he
wouldn’t swallow his pride. Something else, I suspect. At home. Hormones. You name it. Anyway, that’s all it
is.
DR. DOANE: But why should a reporter call me?
DR. PALLENI: I don’t know. As I said, she called me too.
DR. DOANE: What did you tell her?
DR. PALLENI: Told her to mind her own business.
DR. DOANE:Joe …
DR. PALLENI: Good Lord, Gert, if I had to discuss every little problem we have with the kids with every fool
reporter …
DR. DOANE: I know. I know.
DR. PALLENI: Do you want me to talk to her? Suppose I could track her down.
DR. DOANE: Not if it was only what you said it was.
DR. PALLENI: It was. Believe me. It was.
DR. DOANE: Okay. If she does call back, you can just refer her to me.
DR. PALLENI: Will do.
DR. DOANE: Have a nice weekend, Joe. Sorry to bother you.
DR. PALLENI: No problem. Have a good one, Gert.
11:45 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Aside from getting out of Narwin’s homeroom—still not out of her English—not much of anything today. Boring!
Newspapers to deliver. Collection day. Can’t understand how people who want the paper think they can get away
with not paying for it. And it comes out of my pocket. Then folks made me do yard work. Clean up room. Ken
came over.
Been trying to figure a way to get on the school track team. Maybe—like the coach said—I should ask Narwin
for extra work. Be worth it. I hate working out without a team….
Article from the Community Section of the Manchester Record
SUSPENDED FOR PATRIOTISM
by J. Stewart, Education Reporter
Harrison. While it may appear to be an April Fools’ Day joke, tenth grader Philip Malloy of Harrison High
School was suspended for singing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
His parents, Susan and Benjamin Malloy of Harrison Township, do not consider themselves superpatriots, but they did raise their son to have pride in our country. It was only natural then for Philip to sing
along when the national anthem was played on tape during morning exercises. According to Harrison School
superintendent Dr. A. Seymour, there is no rule against singing the anthem. Indeed, in every other class Philip
did just that. His new homeroom teacher, Ms. Margaret Narwin, however, changed the rules. Every time
Philip lifted his voice to sing she threw him out of class, insisting a disturbance was being created.
School principal Dr. Gertrude Doane, who admits that Philip has no previous bad marks on his record,
saw the issue only as one of discipline, and referred all questions regarding school policy to Dr. Joseph
Palleni, assistant principal. Dr. Palleni, however, refused to be interviewed regarding the incident.
What will young Malloy—who has his own delivery route for the Manchester Record—do during his
suspension from school? Philip, who still hopes to make the school track team this spring, said, “Try to keep
up with my work, and work out with classmates after school.”
Harrison Township will be voting on a new school district budget this spring, along with a new school
board.

Phone Conversation between Dr. Albert Seymour and Dr. Gertrude Doane
DR. SEYMOUR: Gertrude?
DR. DOANE: This is Gertrude Doane.
DR. SEYMOUR: Gertrude, Al Seymour here. Did you see this morning’s paper?
DR. DOANE:Just reading the first section now.
DR. SEYMOUR: Well, look at section D. Community news. Page two. School news.
DR. DOANE: Why?
DR. SEYMOUR:Just do it.
DR. DOANE: Hold on a moment.
DR. SEYMOUR: Did you find it?
DR. DOANE: Yes, and I … Oh my!
DR. SEYMOUR: Read it.
DR. DOANE: This is ridiculous!
DR. SEYMOUR: What is this business? I had a call from a reporter yesterday, but … Is any of this true?
DR. DOANE: Al, the boy was not suspended because of singing the national anthem. Of course not. He was
suspended because he was creating a disturbance. That’s according to Joe.
DR. SEYMOUR:Joe?
DR. DOANE:Joe Palleni.
DR. SEYMOUR: A disturbance by singing? Singing “The Star-Spangled Banner”?
DR. DOANE: Yes. Joe handled it.
DR. SEYMOUR: Who is this Narwin woman?
DR. DOANE: An English teacher. She’s been on the staff for years. Actually, longest of all, I think. A good teacher.
DR. SEYMOUR: Oh, yes. Think I know her. And that’s all there is to it?
DR. DOANE: As far as I know.
DR. SEYMOUR: Let’s hope so. I mean …
DR. DOANE: Al, no one could take this seriously.
DR. SEYMOUR: I hope not. I hope not. With the budget vote soon … and the school board—
DR. DOANE: Do you want me to call the newspaper?
DR. SEYMOUR: Ah … no. But if you get any calls you can refer them all to me. To my office. Tomorrow.
DR. DOANE: I will.
DR. SEYMOUR: This is not going to do us any good.
DR. DOANE: No one reads about schools.
DR. SEYMOUR: Let’s hope so.

Phone Conversation between Philip Malloy and Ken Barchet
PHILIP MALLOY: What’s happening?
KEN BARCHET: Did you see the paper?
PHILIP MALLOY: I deliver it. I don’t have to read it.
KEN BARCHET: Guess what my ma found in it.
PHILIP MALLOY: What?
KEN BARCHET: It’s all about you.
PHILIP MALLOY: Sure. April fool.
KEN BARCHET: No. Really. Look at section D. Page two. A riot.
PHILIP MALLOY: Sure.
KEN BARCHET: It ain’t true. But it’s funny. We working out?
PHILIP MALLOY: Have to visit my grandma at the nursing home.
KEN BARCHET: Make sure they don’t lock you up. See you.
PHILIP MALLOY: Catch you later.
KEN BARCHET: Don’t forget to look.
PHILIP MALLOY: April fool.

Conversation between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MRS. MALLOY: Look here, Ben. That reporter did put in a story about Philip.
MR. MALLOY: You’re kidding! Let me see.
MRS. MALLOY: Here.
MR. MALLOY: I’ll be….
MRS. MALLOY: It’s got the whole thing.
MR. MALLOY: See, the superintendent says there’s no such rule. It was just that teacher.
MRS. MALLOY: Doesn’t seem right.
MR. MALLOY: She should be fired. Philip upstairs?
MRS. MALLOY: Think so.
MR. MALLOY: Philip! Come on down here and look at this.
PHILIP MALLOY: What?
MRS. MALLOY: This.
MR. MALLOY: See. If you stick up for yourself, you get action. How’s that make you feel? Philip? What do you
think?
MRS. MALLOY: What’s the matter?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know.
MRS. MALLOY: It was the teacher. Just as you said.
PHILIP MALLOY: Weird …
MR. MALLOY:Just shows you—
MRS. MALLOY: Where are you going?
PHILIP MALLOY: Upstairs.
MRS. MALLOY: We’re leaving in half an hour.
MR. MALLOY: Sometimes you just have to deal with things.
MRS. MALLOY: He looked like he was reading his own funeral notice.
MR. MALLOY: Kids …
MRS. MALLOY: Well, anyway, you were right. Now maybe the boy can go back to school on Monday. Isn’t it odd to
see your name in the paper?

MRS. MALLOY: That Ted Griffen. He knows how to get things done.
MR. MALLOY: Got my vote.

Phone Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Her Sister, Anita Wigham
MARGARET NARWIN: I just don’t understand why they would ever print such a thing.
ANITA WIGHAM: That’s the papers….
MARGARET NARWIN: It’s so slanted.
ANITA WIGHAM: Peg, I don’t think anybody will pay much attention to it. Just tell people the truth. Put your faith in
that.
MARGARET NARWIN: I suppose you’re right. It’s just …
ANITA WIGHAM: It will pass.

From a Speech Delivered by Ted Griffen to a Meeting of the Harrison Sunday Fellowship
MR. GRIFFEN: … so what I will try to do—if elected as a member of the Harrison School Board—is not just keep
the cost of education down to a reasonable level—keeping our taxes down—I will work with the rest of the
board to support basic American values. For I—and I can only speak for myself—I am shocked that a Harrison
student should be suspended from one of our schools because he desires to sing the national anthem. Yes, my
friends, it is true. It has happened here. Here—in today’s Record—is the sad story. And I say, what is the point
of installing computers—which my generation never seemed to need—and at great cost—if our young people
are not allowed to practice the elemental values of American patriotism?

From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Folks excited—mostly Dad—by a newspaper story about what happened in school. Wonder what will happen
now. Dad keeps telling me how great I am.
Maybe they’ll kick Miss Narwin out. Wonder if she even saw it. It’s her fault. Not mine.
No one called. I guess I don’t go to school tomorrow.
Watched some track on TV. Steve Hallick lost a race. Said he wasn’t ready. Can’t believe it.
Finished The Outsiders. Not bad. Wonder what it would be like to live without parents. You could do what
you’d like.
From American Affiliated Press Wire Service
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM
Harrison, NH. A tenth grader was suspended from his local school because he sang “The Star-Spangled
Banner” during the school’s morning exercises. The boy, Philip Malloy, who wished to sing in the spirit of
patriotism, was then forced to remain home alone, since both his parents work. English teacher Margaret
Narwin, who brought about the suspension, maintains the boy was making a nuisance of himself.

JAKE BARLOW: Okay. Okay. Here we go! All sorts of things we can talk about. Wanting—and waiting—to hear
from you on WLRB, your talk radio with your loudmouthed host Jake Barlow ready to take you on. Ready.
Willing. And able! All kinds of things going on. We can talk about that demonstration in Washington. I don’t
know about that. I don’t know. Bunch of … Hey, what do you think about that point-shaving scandal over at that
university in the Midwest? Come on, guys, is that an education or what? Then there’s the president, who’s said
he would be an education president. But he’s got his work cut out for him. I’m telling you because here’s a bit
of a story, bit of a story, that came in over the wires. Don’t know if you saw this. Let me read it to you. Now,
listen up! This is America. I mean it! WLRB asking you—Jake Barlow asking you—what you think of this.
Now, remember, I’m not making this up. None of it. I’m reading it!
“KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM.”
Right. You heard me correct. “KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM.” But you ain’t heard nothing yet. Listen
to this!
“Harrison, New Hampshire.”
Where in the world is Harrison? In the United States? In America? Listen up, New Hampshire. All their auto
plates read “Live free or die.” Well, something died, because this is what is going on there right now! Here it is.
The whole story. Right in the morning news. I’m just quoting.
“A tenth grader was suspended from his local school because he sang ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ during the
school’s morning exercises. The boy, Philip Malloy, who wished to sing in the spirit of patriotism, was then
forced to remain home alone, since both his parents work. English teacher Margaret Narwin, who brought about

Phone Conversation between Mrs. Gloria Harland, Chairman, Harrison School Board, and Dr. Albert
Seymour, Superintendent of Schools
MRS. HARLAND: Albert, this is Gloria Harland. Good morning.
DR. SEYMOUR: Gloria! Good morning. Looks like spring is here.
MRS. HARLAND: It is balmy, isn’t it? Albert, last night I attended a meeting of the Harrison Sunday Fellowship….
DR. SEYMOUR: Oh, yes. Couldn’t make it.
MRS. HARLAND: Well, Ted Griffen made a speech.
DR. SEYMOUR: Ted Griffen?
MRS. HARLAND: He’s running for the school board.
DR. SEYMOUR: Oh, yes. Right. They’re doing a series of talks. Know him. Know him well. Bit hard and—
MRS. HARLAND: Albert, part of Ted’s speech was an attack on the present board in regard to what he claims is the
suspension of a student for singing the national anthem in one of the schools. High school, I think.
DR. SEYMOUR: The what?
MRS. HARLAND: Suspension for singing the national anthem. “The Star-Spangled Banner.” And—to my shock—I
checked and sure enough, as he said, I saw something about it in the paper yesterday. The Sunday paper. What
is this all about? We have the vote …
DR. SEYMOUR: Oh, Lord, is he going to make a thing about this?
MRS. HARLAND: What happened? It’s not true, is it?
DR. SEYMOUR: Gloria, I can assure you nothing of the kind occurred. Nothing. But before I go off half-cocked, let
me make some further inquiries and then get back to you.
MRS. HARLAND: Soon.
DR. SEYMOUR: Absolutely. Soon.
MRS. HARLAND: Al, this is not what we need. Not with the budget vote so—
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. I understand.

JAKE BARLOW: Okay. Okay. Back again. And ready to take you on. We’ve got the scandal out at the U. The
demonstration in D.C. The kid kicked out of school for being an American patriot. Anything you want. Here we
go. First call. Hello?
CALLER: Is this Jake?
JAKE BARLOW:Jake Cruising-for-a-Bruising Barlow. Who’s this?
CALLER: This is Steve.
JAKE BARLOW: Steve! How you doing, big guy?
STEVE: Great. Really like your show. You’re doing great.
JAKE BARLOW: Don’t tell me! Tell the president of the station, Steve.
STEVE: Yeah. Ha-ha! Right. Look—about that kid.
JAKE BARLOW: The one kicked out of school for singing “The Star-Spangled Banner”?
STEVE: Yeah. Hey, you know, that gripes me. Really does. Things may be different. But, come off it!
JAKE BARLOW: Right! What are schools for, anyway?
STEVE: People might call me a—a—
JAKE BARLOW:Jerk?
STEVE: Yeah, maybe. But like they used to say, America, love it or leave it. And that school—
JAKE BARLOW: It was a teacher.
STEVE: Yeah, teacher. She shouldn’t be allowed to teach. That’s my opinion.
JAKE BARLOW: Right. I’m right with you there, Steve. I mean, there are the three R’s—reading, ’riting, and
’rithmetic—and the three P’s—prayer, patriotism, and parents. At least, that’s my notion of schooling.
STEVE: Right. I’m right with you.
JAKE BARLOW: Okay, Steve. Like what you said. Let’s see if we got any ultraliberals out there who’ll call in and try
to defend this—I was about to say woman—person. Steve! Thanks for calling.
STEVE: Yeah.
JAKE BARLOW: Who’s next?

Conversation between Dr. Albert Seymour and Dr. Gertrude Doane
DR. SEYMOUR: Gert, Albert Seymour here. Look, I got a call from Gloria Harland about this boy who was
suspended for singing.
DR. DOANE: Al, I told you, that’s not why the boy was suspended.
DR. SEYMOUR: Maybe yes. Maybe no. That’s not what’s at stake here. I’ve got this budget…. Now listen. She was
at a meeting last night at which this guy, Ted Griffen—
DR. DOANE: He’s running for the school board.
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. And wouldn’t you know, he’s making speeches about the incident, claiming it’s school
policy to keep kids from singing—
DR. DOANE: Al, that’s absolutely untrue.
DR. SEYMOUR: Gert, you know as well as I, it doesn’t matter if it’s true or not true. It’s what people are saying
that’s important. Will be saying. Who’s involved in this thing?
DR. DOANE:Joe Palleni, Peg Narwin, myself.
DR. SEYMOUR: I want a report on my desk—a report I can read out. So make it short and to the point. Soon as you
can.
DR. DOANE: Al …
DR. SEYMOUR: Gert, believe me. I’m sensitive to this sort of thing. Just do as I’ve requested.

JAKE BARLOW: Liz baby! How you doing?
LIZ:Just fine.
JAKE BARLOW: Liz, what’s on your pretty mind this morning?
LIZ:Jake, I’m a mother. I have three kids. All school-age. But if I had a teacher like that—
JAKE BARLOW: Whoa! Back off. Like who?
LIZ: The one who forbade that child to show his patriotism in school….
JAKE BARLOW: Right.
LIZ: I’d take my kids out of school.
JAKE BARLOW: You would?
LIZ: No question about it.
JAKE BARLOW: What about the teacher?
LIZ: Wouldn’t let my kids go back to that school unless she was removed.
JAKE BARLOW: The teacher doesn’t have rights?
LIZ: It’s a free country. But what I’m saying is that she has no right to do what she does. My husband was in the
military. She’s taking away rights. Like the flag thing.
JAKE BARLOW: Then you know.
LIZ: I do.

Conversation between Robert Duval, Reporter for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and Dr. Gertrude Doane
MR. DUVAL: Is this Miss Doane, principal of Harrison High School?
DR. DOANE: Yes. Dr. Doane.
MR. DUVAL: Thank you. Of course. Dr. Doane, my name is Robert Duval. I’m a reporter with the St. Louis PostDispatch.
DR. DOANE: St. Louis?
MR. DUVAL: That’s right. I’m calling from St. Louis, Missouri. I’m attempting to follow up on an AAP release that
indicates your school suspended a student because he sang “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
DR. DOANE: Did you say St. Louis?
MR. DUVAL: Yes, ma’am. Took the story off the wire service. And we ran it. Now you see, we have a convention
going on here, our state American Legion convention. Someone there noticed this item and called the paper to
see if we had any more information about the situation.
DR. DOANE: Are you serious?
MR. DUVAL: Certainly am. Would you care to hear the story we ran?
DR. DOANE: Ah … yes.
MR. DUVAL: The headline reads “KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM.”
DR. DOANE: Good grief!
MR. DUVAL: Yes, ma’am. Let me read you the rest. “Harrison, New Hampshire. A tenth grader was suspended from
his local school because he sang ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ during the school’s morning exercises. The boy,
Philip Malloy, who wished to sing in the spirit of patriotism, was then forced to remain home alone, since both
his parents work. English teacher Margaret Narwin, who brought about the suspension, maintains the boy was
making a nuisance of himself.” That’s it.
DR. DOANE: My God…. Is that being sent out over the whole country?
MR. DUVAL: Well, actually, has been sent out. And I thought to call and get your response. Would you like to
comment, ma’am?
DR. DOANE: Full of mistakes. For a start he’s a ninth grader…. Look, can I get back to you?
MR. DUVAL: Aren’t you in a position to respond now?
DR. DOANE: There has been some great mistake, and … None of this is true.
MR. DUVAL: None of it? The boy was not suspended, then?
DR. DOANE: Yes, suspended, but not for those reasons. Look, Mr. Duval, I have to sort this out.
MR. DUVAL: When can I call back?
DR. DOANE: Give me a few hours.
MR. DUVAL: Yes, ma’am.

JAKE BARLOW: Back again. Who’s on?
CALLER: This is Roger.
JAKE BARLOW: Roger Rabbit?
ROGER: Not quite.
JAKE BARLOW: How many kids do you have?
ROGER: Ahhh … two.
JAKE BARLOW: Get hopping, Roger, get hopping. Ha! Okay, Roger, what’s on your mind?
ROGER: About all these calls you’re getting, the boy who was kicked out.
JAKE BARLOW: Makes me sick. Sick!
ROGER: Well, you’ve read the news story a few times, so I think I’ve understood it. And it just seems to me that that
couldn’t be the whole story.
JAKE BARLOW: What do you mean?
ROGER: Well, the story is slanted from the point of view of the boy. It doesn’t really indicate what the teacher’s
position is.
JAKE BARLOW: Roger—let me get this right—you are defending this so-called teacher?
ROGER: No, I didn’t say that. I’m not defending anyone. The story you read is just the boy’s, not the teacher’s. Why
should we assume that the teacher is wrong?
JAKE BARLOW: Come on. Give us a break. The kid was suspended, right?
ROGER: So it would appear.
JAKE BARLOW: Suspended for singing the national anthem, right?
ROGER: That’s the story you read.
JAKE BARLOW: Now, how could singing the national anthem—Oh, say, can you see … —ever … ever … ever be
making a nuisance?
ROGER: Well …
JAKE BARLOW: Roger, what’s your point? Let me make a guess. You’re a teacher!
ROGER: Actually, I’m a salesman.
JAKE BARLOW: What do you sell?
ROGER: That doesn’t make—
JAKE BARLOW: Come on! Out with it! Admit it.
ROGER: Well, books, but …
JAKE BARLOW: Yeah, see, exactly. And here you are defending this creep of a teacher. What does the kid know
other than his own, natural-born patriotism? And then this creep of a teacher comes along and squelches it. And
this country has all these problems with morality, drugs, pornography. No way, José. Hey, Roger, you saying
pornography is only a nuisance?
ROGER: But—
JAKE BARLOW: Good-bye! Always the one rotten apple. Hey, out there. Do you agree with this guy? Tell you what!
Why don’t you out there—let’s start a crusade—I want you all—if you feel anything about all this—to write to
the teacher. Hey, free country! Do you agree with what she did? Okay, tell her. If you disagree, tell her that.
Let’s see, here’s her name, Margaret Narwin. Margaret Narwin. N–a–r–w–i–n. Harrison, New Hampshire. Let
her know what you think. You agree with that guy? Just write her. Postcard. Brick. Hey, just kidding.

Conversation among Dr. Gertrude Doane, Margaret Narwin, and Dr. Joseph Palleni
DR. DOANE: Peg, just tell me what happened.
MISS NARWIN: I’ve told you twice now.
DR. DOANE: I know you’re upset, Peg. But I have to get it down clearly. Anyway, we all need to tell the same story.
DR. PALLENI: Amen. Gert’s trying to be helpful, Peg.
MISS NARWIN: It’s terribly upsetting.
DR. DOANE: Well, yes…. To all of us. Now, once more. Please.
MISS NARWIN: Very well…. Philip Malloy—from the first day he entered my homeroom—last week—during the
time the students are asked to stand in silence—
DR. PALLENI: The rule is, “Respectful silence.” I looked it up. It’s in your memo about opening exercises. Isn’t in
the student handbook. But I think it should be.
DR. DOANE: Good point.
MISS NARWIN: During the playing of the national anthem, he sang. Loudly. With no respect. Very loudly. To make a
commotion. Obviously. The first time he did it, I asked him to stop, and he did. After a bit. The second two
times, he didn’t. Refused. That’s when I sent him to Joe. Both times.
DR. PALLENI: The boy admitted it, Gert. No bones about that.
MISS NARWIN: Deliberately provocative.
DR. DOANE: Do we know why? Peg?
MISS NARWIN: I haven’t the slightest idea.
DR. DOANE:Joe?
DR. PALLENI: Nope. No problems before. Ever.
DR. DOANE: Maybe I should talk to some students.
DR. PALLENI: Witnesses.
MISS NARWIN: I don’t know. I will say this, Gert, he’s always been restless in English class. Sort of a wise guy, I’d
have to call him. Trying to cover up laziness with smart talk. I don’t know why. Sometimes that just happens.
The chemistry. In his last exam for me he wrote a very foolish, really provocative answer. Mocking me.
DR. DOANE: You?
MISS NARWIN: Oh, yes. Absolutely. Mocking.
DR. DOANE: Do you still have it?
MISS NARWIN: I always return exams to students.
DR. DOANE: Too bad. But there must be some reason—
MISS NARWIN: I agree.
DR. PALLENI: Home, Gert. Home. Ninety-nine point nine times out of a hundred, you get a thing like this, a kid
acting out, believe me, it’s home. Acting out here for what’s happening there.
DR. DOANE: But we don’t know that.
DR. PALLENI: Hey, what’s the difference? They always blame the school. You know that.
DR. DOANE: Well, as far as I’m concerned, this is strictly a discipline problem. That’s what I intend to tell people.
Do we agree?
DR. PALLENI: Well, the thing is, it’s the truth.
MISS NARWIN: I didn’t think it was wise to suspend him.
DR. PALLENI: Two infractions in one week, Peg. Right? That’s the rule. You sent him out. To me. If we start
bending the rules each time …
MISS NARWIN: What could I have done?
DR. PALLENI: Only trying to be supportive.
MISS NARWIN: I know.
DR. DOANE: It’ll blow over.
DR. PALLENI: Sure thing.
DR. DOANE: Joe, write up a draft of something—keep strictly to the facts—to give to Seymour. Do it immediately. I
want to speak to some students.

Written by Dr. Joseph Palleni
TO: SEYMOUR
FROM: DOANE
RE: SUSPENSION OF PHILIP MALLOY
1. Each morning—during homeroom period—the national anthem is played over the high school announcement
system.
2. At such times students are asked: “Please all rise and stand at respectful, silent attention …”
3. On March 28, March 29, and March 30, Philip Malloy caused a disturbance in his homeroom class (Margaret
Narwin, teacher) by singing the national anthem in a loud, raucous, disrespectful manner.
4. When asked by Miss Narwin—on the first occasion—to cease, Philip Malloy reluctantly did so. But on the
second and third occasions, he refused and was sent to Assistant Principal Joe Palleni for discipline.
5. Philip Malloy does not dispute the above facts.
6. On the third occurrence, Philip Malloy was asked to promise not to show such a disrespectful attitude, and to
apologize to the teacher and to his fellow classmates. He refused.
7. Dr. Palleni, following his principal’s guidelines, therefore suspended Philip Malloy from class for two days in
hopes that he would learn to show proper respect toward the national anthem, school, teacher, and fellow students.
8. It should be noted that Philip Malloy was reported to show inappropriate behavior in his regular English
classes with Miss Narwin.

Conversation between Dr. Gertrude Doane and Ken Barchet
DR. DOANE: Ken, I’m trying to understand what happened there. That morning. Is this clear?
KEN BARCHET: Yes.
DR. DOANE: And you were with him. I hope you can speak freely. I’m just trying to work it out.
KEN BARCHET: Sure.
DR. DOANE: So, in your view—what occurred?
KEN BARCHET: Well, you know, the tape, the music went on—
DR. DOANE: Which day was this?
KEN BARCHET: Wednesday.
DR. DOANE: Okay. Wednesday. Go on.
KEN BARCHET: Right. The music went on. And we were just standing there. We’re supposed to. And the next thing,
Miss Narwin was telling Philip to stop.
DR. DOANE: Stop what?
KEN BARCHET: I’m not sure. The newspaper said singing.
DR. DOANE: What about the other days?
KEN BARCHET: You know, he was, again, sort of, I guess, singing.
DR. DOANE: In what way?
KEN BARCHET:Just singing.
DR. DOANE: Loudly?
KEN BARCHET: Well, not really.
DR. DOANE: But you heard him?
KEN BARCHET: I guess.
DR. DOANE: How close to Philip do you sit?
KEN BARCHET: ’Cross the room.
DR. DOANE: So, loudly enough for you to hear?
KEN BARCHET: Well …
DR. DOANE: Then what happened?
KEN BARCHET: Miss Narwin got mad.
DR. DOANE: Why?
KEN BARCHET: Well, you know, like you said, Philip was singing. And I guess we’re not supposed to.
DR. DOANE: Did Philip stop?
KEN BARCHET: Yeah. When she told him to get out.
DR. DOANE: Not before?
KEN BARCHET: No.
DR. DOANE: What did the class do?
KEN BARCHET: I wasn’t paying attention.

PHILIP MALLOY: What you tell her?
KEN BARCHET: What happened. The whole thing. Lot of people talking about it. You know, with the newspaper and
all.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah, but what did you tell her?
KEN BARCHET: I thought I should tell her how funny it was.
PHILIP MALLOY: Come on! What did you tell her?
KEN BARCHET: Nothing. I mean, it wasn’t anything. I don’t know why they’re making a fuss about it.
PHILIP MALLOY: I still have English with her, but they switched me back to Lunser’s homeroom.
KEN BARCHET: He’s okay. Tells good jokes. Someone told me he has a collection of joke books. That’s where he
gets all those one-liners.
PHILIP MALLOY: That true?
KEN BARCHET: Nick told me. We going to work out this afternoon?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah.

Conversation between Dr. Gertrude Doane and Cynthia Gambia, Student
DR. DOANE: Cynthia, what I’m trying to do is understand what happened in Miss Narwin’s homeroom class. With
Philip Malloy. When these incidents occurred. I hope you can tell me exactly what you saw. I’m trying to work
it out.
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Yes. I understand. I wasn’t paying much attention.
DR. DOANE: That’s all right. Go on. Tell me what happened as you saw it.
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Well, during “The Star-Spangled Banner”—when the tape went on—Philip started to hum.
DR. DOANE: Hum?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: I think so.
DR. DOANE: Not sing?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: I’m not sure. It could have been. I wasn’t paying attention. Not at first. Not the first time.
DR. DOANE: And then?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Miss Narwin asked him to leave.
DR. DOANE: Which days were these?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: All three.
DR. DOANE: Was Philip causing a disturbance?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Well, I heard him. Sort of. I mean, it wasn’t loud or anything. Not like the paper said. But he
wouldn’t stop. And she did ask him. I guess that was the disturbance.
DR. DOANE: So he wasn’t loud.
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Maybe the last time.
DR. DOANE: Very loud?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Well, loud.
DR. DOANE: What day was that?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Ah … Tuesday. Or Thursday. I’m not sure.
DR. DOANE: What did the other students do?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Nothing. I don’t think they knew anything was going to happen. If they did, they would have
watched.
DR. DOANE: Do you have any idea why he—Philip—did this?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: No.
DR. DOANE: Did you want to add anything else?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: No. I guess not. I mean, he was being sort of rude.
DR. DOANE: Philip?
CYNTHIA GAMBIA: Miss Narwin did ask him to stop. You’re supposed to be quiet. Everybody says that’s the rule.
He certainly wasn’t. She’s a fair teacher. All the kids say so.

speak for you too—I am shocked that a Harrison student should be expelled from one of our schools simply
because he desires to sing the national anthem. Yes, my friends, it is true. It has happened here. Here—in
yesterday’s Record is the full story. Shocking. What I say is—most emphatically—what is the point of
installing computers—which my generation never seemed to need—and at great cost—if our young people are
not allowed to practice the elemental values of American patriotism? Is that the way we budget our education
dollars?

Conversation between Dr. Gertrude Doane and Allison Doresett
DR. DOANE: Allison, I’m working hard to understand what happened in Miss Narwin’s class. The incident with
Philip Malloy.
ALLISON DORESETT: I know. Lot of kids are talking about it.
DR. DOANE: What are they saying?
ALLISON DORESETT: About how big a thing it is.
DR. DOANE: Do you think it is?
ALLISON DORESETT: I don’t know. Maybe. If they pay all that attention. I mean, someone said the TV would be here.
DR. DOANE: I hope not. Now, as I understand it, you are in Miss Narwin’s homeroom class.
ALLISON DORESETT: I have English with her too.
DR. DOANE: I’m talking about homeroom.
ALLISON DORESETT: I have her.
DR. DOANE: So you were there all three times?
ALLISON DORESETT: Uh-huh.
DR. DOANE: Tell me what you saw.
ALLISON DORESETT: Well, Philip, he doesn’t like Miss Narwin.
DR. DOANE: He doesn’t?
ALLISON DORESETT: I don’t think so.
DR. DOANE:Just think? Do you know why?
ALLISON DORESETT: It’s what people are saying. In class—English class—he just sits there, you know, like he’s
bored and can’t stand anything she says. It’s just the way he looks. On his face. You know. But then he suddenly
makes some remark, a joke or something. Something funny.
DR. DOANE: Do you think this has anything to do with what happened?
ALLISON DORESETT: Well, it was so obvious he was trying to get at her.
DR. DOANE: What do you mean?
ALLISON DORESETT: Get her mad.
DR. DOANE: Because he doesn’t like her?
ALLISON DORESETT: He’s been so moody lately. Those times in homeroom—I think he was doing it to get Miss
Narwin in trouble.
DR. DOANE: I wish you’d tell me more about that.
ALLISON DORESETT: Well, he’s been angry a lot lately. I go home on the same bus with him. The other day I—you
know—tried to sit next to him. On the bus. He was looking all angry. I tried to talk to him.
DR. DOANE: And?
ALLISON DORESETT: He got all angry. Wouldn’t talk to me.
DR. DOANE: Do you know why?
ALLISON DORESETT: That’s the way he is.
DR. DOANE: Allison, I appreciate your help.
ALLISON DORESETT: Can I say something?
DR. DOANE: Of course.

1. Each and every morning—during homeroom period—the national anthem is played over the high school
announcement system.
2. At such times all students are asked, to quote the standard district guide, “Please all rise and stand at respectful,
silent attention….” At no time in the history of this procedure has any disturbance been recorded.
3. On March 28, March 29, and March 30, Philip Malloy deliberately caused a disturbance in his homeroom class
(Margaret Narwin, teacher) by singing the national anthem in a loud, raucous, disrespectful fashion, thereby
drawing attention to himself.
4. When requested by Miss Narwin—on the first occasion—to cease, Philip Malloy did so, albeit reluctantly. On
the second and third occasions, he repeated his disrespectful behavior, and when he refused to stop, he was sent—
standard procedure—to Assistant Principal Dr. Joseph Palleni for discipline.
5. Philip Malloy did not dispute the above facts.
6. A random selection of students—who were in the classroom at the time—confirms these events. Indeed, there is
evidence that Philip Malloy’s acts were indicative of some personal animosity he feels toward the homeroom
teacher, Miss Narwin. His rudeness was also on display in the English classes he had with her. His grade there
indicates inferior work.
7. On the third occurrence, Philip Malloy was asked 1) to promise not to show such a disrespectful attitude
toward our national anthem and 2) to apologize to his teacher and his classmates for his behavior. He refused,
choosing the option afforded him of suspension.
8. Dr. Palleni, following district guidelines approved by the Superintendent, therefore suspended Philip Malloy
from class for two days in hopes that he would learn to show proper respect toward the national anthem, his
school, his teacher, and his fellow students.

RE: SUSPENSION OF PHILIP MALLOY
1. It is the practice in all Harrison schools that each and every morning—during homeroom period—the national
anthem is played over the announcement systems. It is part of our general ongoing program of support for
traditional American values.
2. At such times all students are asked to “Please all rise and stand at respectful, silent attention….” In past years
our desire for a dignified moment of patriotism has been firmly maintained. At no time in the history of this
program has any disturbance been recorded.
3. On March 28, March 29, and March 30, Philip Malloy deliberately caused a disturbance in his homeroom class
(Margaret Narwin, a teacher of twenty years’ standing) by singing the national anthem in a loud, raucous,
disrespectful fashion, thereby drawing attention to himself and away from the words. There are strong indications
that he was acting out some personal animosity toward the teacher in question for reasons unknown. His school
performance has been inferior. (It has been suggested that there may be problems in the home arena. Please note,
however, that the law requires schools to keep such personal information confidential.)
4. When requested by his teacher, Miss Narwin, on the first occasion to maintain a dignified response to the
national anthem, Philip Malloy did so, though reluctantly. On the second and third occasions, he repeated his
disrespectful acts, and when he refused to stop, he was—as a matter of course—sent to Assistant Principal Dr.
Joseph Palleni for discipline.
5. Philip Malloy—when given the opportunity—did not dispute the above facts.
6. Students who were in the classroom at the time of the incidents confirm these events.
7. On the third occurrence, Philip Malloy was requested 1) to promise that he would show an attitude of respect
toward our national anthem and 2) to apologize to his teacher and his classmates for his rude behavior. He
refused, choosing the option of suspension himself.
8. Dr. Palleni, following district guidelines approved by the School Board, therefore suspended Philip Malloy
from class for two days in hopes that he would learn to show proper respect toward the national anthem and his
school, teacher, and fellow students.

MRS. MALLOY: You should be pleased with yourself.
MR. MALLOY: What do you think of that telegram?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know. Who are they? I never heard of them before.
MR. MALLOY: They’ve heard of you. You’re famous.
PHILIP MALLOY: How?
MRS. MALLOY: In the news, wasn’t it?
PHILIP MALLOY: You think so?
MR. MALLOY: Sure. Just shows you. One person makes a difference. One person standing up for what he believes
in.
MRS. MALLOY: I’m just so glad it’s worked out all right. Aren’t you?
PHILIP MALLOY: I suppose.
MR. MALLOY: What’s the problem now?
PHILIP MALLOY: Be weird going back. What kids will say.
MR. MALLOY: They’ll be on your side. You said they all hated that woman. Just make sure you sing in the morning.
People will look to that.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’ll be in Mr. Lunser’s class.
MR. MALLOY: You said he likes kids singing.
PHILIP MALLOY: Sort of.
MR. MALLOY: I think you should go over and speak to Ted Griffen too.
PHILIP MALLOY: Why?
MR. MALLOY: Someone at work heard him at some speech he gave—the school board thing—he mentioned this
whole business….
PHILIP MALLOY: He did?
MRS. MALLOY: And he brought in that reporter.
MR. MALLOY: Come on, Philip, people are really on your side!
PHILIP MALLOY: I guess.

From a Speech Delivered by Ted Griffen to a Meeting of the Harrison Chamber of Commerce
MR. GRIFFEN: Before I get into my formal speech, I’d like to lead off—put it right at the top of your thoughts—with
something that has happened here in Harrison, something that has disturbed me greatly. I am a great believer in
basic American values. And let me tell you good people—and I am sure I speak for you too—I am shocked that
a Harrison student should be expelled from one of our schools because he desires to sing the national anthem.
Yes, my friends, it is the truth. It has happened here. Here—in yesterday’s Record is the full story. Shocking.
What I say is—most emphatically—what is the point of installing computers—which my generation never
seemed to need—and at great cost—if our young people are not allowed to practice the elemental values of
American patriotism? And to think—because this story—so I understand—this has been picked up by the
national press—how shocking it is that this is the way our town of Harrison should come to be known. It
should not be condoned!

Phone Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Her Sister, Anita Wigham
MISS NARWIN: Hello?
ANITA WIGHAM: Peg!
MISS NARWIN: Anita, yes, dear, what is it? What’s the matter?
ANITA WIGHAM: I … I …
MISS NARWIN: What is it?
ANITA WIGHAM: I was just reading the evening paper—and right on page one … is this story—it’s this story about
you!
MISS NARWIN: What are you talking about?
ANITA WIGHAM: It’s right here.
MISS NARWIN: Are you sure?
ANITA WIGHAM: Absolutely sure. It must be everywhere.
MISS NARWIN: What does it say?
ANITA WIGHAM: I’ll read it. It’s so awful, Peg. It says, “KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM.” That’s the
headline. It’s just one of those boxed stories. But it’s on the front page. “Harrison, New Hampshire. AAP. A
tenth grader was suspended from his local school because he sang ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ during the
school’s morning exercises. The boy, Philip Malloy, who wished to sing in the spirit of patriotism, was then
forced to remain home alone, since both his parents work. English teacher Margaret Narwin, who brought
about the suspension, maintains the boy was making a nuisance of himself.” Peg, I don’t understand. Peg?
MISS NARWIN: I …
ANITA WIGHAM: But why—
MISS NARWIN: And this was in your newspaper?
ANITA WIGHAM: Peg, I’m holding it.
MISS NARWIN: Dear God….
ANITA WIGHAM: It’s not true, is it?
MISS NARWIN: No. None of it.
ANITA WIGHAM: But where does it come from?

DR. DOANE: Yes, Peg, hello. How are you?
MISS NARWIN: Gert, I …
DR. DOANE: Peg, are you all right?
MISS NARWIN: Gert, I just got a call from my sister—in Florida—about a newspaper story—published there—about
this business—
DR. DOANE: I know, Peg. I’ve already heard about it.
MISS NARWIN: But I—
DR. DOANE: I just didn’t see any point in upsetting you any more.
MISS NARWIN: But why?
DR. DOANE: I already received a call from some midwestern reporter. There have been telegrams—
MISS NARWIN: Telegrams?
DR. DOANE: At school. I told the office to hold them. Peg, it’s gotten out of hand. I don’t know how. It seems there
are these radio talk shows—
MISS NARWIN: I want to see them. What do the telegrams say?
DR. DOANE: Well, they believe what the story says and … Believe me, Peg, I know. It’s all a mistake.
MISS NARWIN: Were they addressed to me? Personally?
DR. DOANE: Well, to me, and yes, some to you, but—
MISS NARWIN: I want to see them.
DR. DOANE: I don’t think—
MISS NARWIN: I don’t understand any of this.
DR. DOANE: Peg, I assure you, I have complete confidence in you.
MISS NARWIN: It’s so monstrous, so …
DR. DOANE: Yes, I agree.
MISS NARWIN: My sister, in Florida …
DR. DOANE: Peg, we’re just going to have to weather it out and—maybe you’ll want to take the day off tomorrow.
MISS NARWIN: No. I can’t give in to this—
DR. DOANE: Peg, believe me. It will calm down.
10:33 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Weird day not doing much. Got these telegrams from these people I never heard of before, talking about something
I don’t get. Folks all high. Be glad to be back in school. I hate sitting around. Glad to be in Lunser’s homeroom
class again. Get things back to normal. Guess I’ll still be in Narwin’s English. Better speak to her and see if I can
do some extra work. So I can get on the track team. Wonder what she’ll say?
Did some extra time on Dad’s rowing machine.
I’m a little nervous.

As a teacher in the Dayton, Ohio, school system for ten years, I am dismayed and horrified that in this day and

DR. DOANE: How many are there?
DR. SEYMOUR: Telegrams? Ten. Fifteen. I haven’t counted exactly. I suspect more will be coming.
DR. DOANE: This one is from Idaho. Incredible!
DR. SEYMOUR: Every one of them demanding we fire this Narwin woman.
DR. DOANE: Not this one.
DR. SEYMOUR: Well, the overwhelming majority. And I had twelve calls at my home last night.
DR. DOANE: From whom?
DR. SEYMOUR: People in town, Gert. People who vote. They’re outraged.
DR. DOANE: And they believe that story….
DR. SEYMOUR: I’m beginning to believe it.
DR. DOANE: Al!
DR. SEYMOUR: What do you expect me to do?
DR. DOANE: Support Peg Narwin.
DR. SEYMOUR: A TV network wants to interview people.
DR. DOANE: You’re not going to let them….
DR. SEYMOUR: No. No. Protect the privacy of minors and all that stuff. From what I gather, talk-show hosts—radio
—have picked the story up…. The board wants me to issue a statement. Gert, I have an appointment with this
Ted Griffen at nine-fifteen.
DR. DOANE: Griffen is running for board….
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. He’s already made speeches about this business. Look, Gert, I’m sorry, but between you
and me—quote me and I’ll deny it—I don’t care about the board. I can handle them. But the budget—I don’t
need to tell you. If we lose again …
DR. DOANE: I know.
DR. SEYMOUR: People scream if the kids are not educated. Then they scream if you ask for the money to do it.
DR. DOANE: I know.
DR. SEYMOUR: I want to see the file on this Narwin woman.
DR. DOANE: Why?
DR. SEYMOUR: I have to decide what to do.
DR. DOANE: Before your meeting with this Griffen?
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. When you get to your office, send one of the secretaries over here with it.
DR. DOANE: Al …
DR. SEYMOUR: Gert, my job is to make sure these kids get educated. Whatever it takes. Send it.

MRS. MALLOY: I’m sure she won’t give you any more trouble.
PHILIP MALLOY: It’s just the other kids….

PHILIP MALLOY: No. Why?
KEN BARCHET: You should change your mind.
PHILIP MALLOY: About what?
KEN BARCHET: Being on the team.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah, I might. I got Mr. Lunser for homeroom.
KEN BARCHET: You told me.
PHILIP MALLOY: Want to know why I didn’t go out for the team?
KEN BARCHET: Okay.
PHILIP MALLOY: Narwin.
KEN BARCHET: What she have to do with it?
PHILIP MALLOY: She almost flunked me in English. That meant I wasn’t allowed to try out.
KEN BARCHET: That why you’re mad at her?
PHILIP MALLOY: But I’m going to ask her if I can do extra work. For credit.
KEN BARCHET: Think she’ll give it to you?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know. No reason she shouldn’t. I’ll ask.
KEN BARCHET: She might be mad at you.
PHILIP MALLOY: If you just tell them you’re sorry, that’s all….
KEN BARCHET: Be great if you could get on the team.
PHILIP MALLOY: That’s what I’ve been saying.

DR. DOANE: Almost two hundred.
MISS NARWIN: There will be letters….
DR. DOANE: Well … The superintendent’s office put out a statement explaining the true situation.
MISS NARWIN: What did he say?
DR. DOANE: Peg, you have to accept the idea that it’s all a misunderstanding.
MISS NARWIN: Easy for you to say.
DR. DOANE: You can’t blame yourself….
MISS NARWIN: I pleaded with Joe not to suspend him.
DR. DOANE: I know you said that. We’ve issued a statement. I think it’s good.
MISS NARWIN: May I see it?
DR. DOANE: Of course. Here. What’s the matter?
MISS NARWIN: This statement doesn’t support me.
DR. DOANE: Peg, it does.
MISS NARWIN: Where?
DR. DOANE: Peg, understand that—
MISS NARWIN: Will the boy be in school today?
DR. DOANE: I suppose…. I need to tell you I said no to some TV people.
MISS NARWIN: No. Absolutely not.
DR. DOANE: Exactly. They can’t come in without permission. Peg, do you want to take the day off?
MISS NARWIN: No. They’ll come to my home.
DR. DOANE: It’s perfectly understandable.
MISS NARWIN: Gert, I don’t understand. I don’t. I have been teaching—
DR. DOANE: People believe what they read.
MISS NARWIN: I have my class….
DR. DOANE: Peg, as of this morning I’ve moved Philip from your English class. He’s with Mr. Keegan.
MISS NARWIN: Why did you do that?
DR. DOANE: Probably for the best….
MISS NARWIN: Best for whom?
DR. DOANE: For you. The boy—
MISS NARWIN: Gert, people will misconstrue.

MR. LUNSER: You want to sing?
STUDENT: Yeah, sing!
MR. LUNSER: Keep the lip buttoned, Brian! Philip?
PHILIP MALLOY: No….
MR. LUNSER: Okay. Just want to make sure your rights are protected.
Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? …
MR. LUNSER: You sure, Philip?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah….
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free and, the home of the brave?

MR. DUVAL: Well, ma’am, I spoke to your local reporter, the woman who broke the story. Ms. Stewart? She gave it
to me. Would you like me to quote from the statement?
DR. DOANE: Mr. Duval, I know what it says.
MR. DUVAL: Now, it’s not exactly in support of your Miss Narwin, is it. Would you agree?
DR. DOANE: Mr. Duval, I really don’t think there’s anything more to say.
MR. DUVAL: What I’m hearing, ma’am, is that you’re not altogether happy with the statement.
DR. DOANE: I did not say that.
MR. DUVAL: I understand. But wouldn’t this teacher—this Miss Narwin—like her side of the story set out?
DR. DOANE: I can’t speak for her. She’s a fine person who—
MR. DUVAL: Dr. Doane, I hope I can understand your conflict. But if I’m understanding this correctly there’s
something like a shift going on here. Against the teacher. Now, I don’t have to go through you. I could approach
her.
DR. DOANE: Why are you so interested?
MR. DUVAL: I sense there’s something more here. I’m not even sure what. I confess that interests me. I sure would
appreciate your cooperation.
DR. DOANE: I would have to ask her.
MR. DUVAL: I understand. But I am prepared to fly East right away.
DR. DOANE: Give me your number again.
MR. DUVAL: Sure thing.

DR. SEYMOUR: Get you some coffee?
MR. GRIFFEN: No, thanks.
DR. SEYMOUR: Looks like we’re finally getting some decent weather.
MR. GRIFFEN: Absolutely.
DR. SEYMOUR: Look, Mr. Griffen—
MR. GRIFFEN: Call me Ted.
DR. SEYMOUR: Fine. Ted. I’m Al. Now, aside from wanting to get to meet you, Ted … I’ve heard you speak—
couple of times—was very interested in what you had to say—I thought it would be a good idea—generally—
to meet you, and sort of, talk things over.
MR. GRIFFEN: Al, I appreciate that.
DR. SEYMOUR: Now—what we’ve got here—well, the media—they never pay attention to us unless something bad
—
MR. GRIFFEN: Right. I never trust anything that’s in print.
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. The bottom line. But we’ve got these elections coming up—budget.
MR. GRIFFEN: And the board.
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. I have a policy—I strongly believe in this—that I’m prepared to work with anyone who’s
on that board—the people’s voice, that sort of thing. And we all want that same thing.
MR. GRIFFEN: Educating the kids.
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. We share that. But the budget thing—
MR. GRIFFEN: Have to keep costs down.
DR. SEYMOUR: Absolutely. But, Ted, I’ll be frank with you. All this publicity—negative publicity—isn’t—won’t—
do us any good.
MR. GRIFFEN: I understand.
DR. SEYMOUR: And, you understand, that first budget was tight—and this second one—to the bone. Get any closer
and we’re scooping marrow. And I understand—no one wants to pay a cent more. But without that budget,
education is in big trouble here in Harrison.
MR. GRIFFEN: People want to hold the line on taxes.
DR. SEYMOUR: I sympathize. I pay taxes too. But—again to be frank—there’s been a real misunderstanding
regarding this national anthem thing. It doesn’t help.
MR. GRIFFEN: Very disturbing.
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. It is. Let me share some of the facts with you.
MR. GRIFFEN: That’s all I’m looking for.
DR. SEYMOUR: I appreciate that. What the media has done is confuse certain things—
MR. GRIFFEN: Something is confused.
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. First, though, let me tell you so you’re quite clear, we have no rule against singing the
national anthem. Never have had. Never will. Not as long as I’m superintendent.
MR. GRIFFEN: But the boy was suspended.
DR. SEYMOUR:Just getting to that. What I suspect here—we’ve got—a personal problem.
MR. GRIFFEN: The boy? He seems—
DR. SEYMOUR: Now, Ted, I’m speaking in confidence.
MR. GRIFFEN: Sure.
DR. SEYMOUR: Then we understand. Ted, it’s not the boy. It’s the teacher.
MR. GRIFFEN: This Narwin gal?
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly.
MR. GRIFFEN: Well, I thought … What kind—between you and me—what kind of a problem?
DR. SEYMOUR: Okay. Let me quote from a letter she wrote—this was to her principal—just a few weeks ago—I
can’t give you a copy, you understand—privacy and all—
MR. GRIFFEN: I understand.
DR. SEYMOUR: But I can read a part of it to you—so you can understand what I’m up against.
MR. GRIFFEN: Sure. Go on.
DR. SEYMOUR: She says—this Narwin woman—yes, here—now, I’m quoting her. “The truth is … I feel that
sometimes”—get this—“I am a little out of touch with contemporary teaching, and, just as important, the
students who come before me.” In other words, she’s been around, what can I say, since history began.
MR. GRIFFEN: Oh boy…. You’ve got a problem there. Tenure.
DR. SEYMOUR: Exactly. The question is, what are you and I going to do about it?

Lunchroom Conversation between Philip Malloy and Todd Becker
TODD BECKER: You don’t have to sit alone, you know.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m okay.
TODD BECKER: Can I sit?
PHILIP MALLOY: Suit yourself.
TODD BECKER: What’s happening?
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing.
TODD BECKER: That true you’re going to be on TV?
PHILIP MALLOY: Who told you that?
TODD BECKER: Susan Vogle.
PHILIP MALLOY: No way.
TODD BECKER: But you’re famous, right? All that newspaper stuff.
PHILIP MALLOY: What you come over here for? Just to tease me?
TODD BECKER:Just trying to be friendly.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah. Sure. Stuff it.
TODD BECKER: Suit yourself.
12:35 P.M.
Faculty Lunchroom Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Mr. Benison
MR. BENISON: You okay, Peg?
MISS NARWIN: Bit of a headache.
MR. BENISON: I saw those telegrams.
MISS NARWIN: It’s awful.
MR. BENISON: Yeah, well, it’s a crazy world. Who’s that guy who said everybody will be famous for a few
minutes?
MISS NARWIN: Andy Warhol. I really can’t stand this.
MR. BENISON: I know. Lot of people upset. That’s for sure.
MISS NARWIN: What do you mean?
MR. BENISON: I must have had ten calls last night saying—neighbors, a couple of family people—asking, is it true? I
told them look, it wasn’t anything like that. That you didn’t mean it to happen that way.
MISS NARWIN: What did you say I meant?
MR. BENISON: You know, some personal thing, happens all the time….
MISS NARWIN: That’s not what it was! The boy was being rude!
MR. BENISON: Okay, Peg, I know that, but no one expected, you know, all this…. What people are saying, we’ll
never get our budget.
MISS NARWIN: I really don’t want to talk about it anymore.
MR. BENISON: Now wait a minute. Peg … don’t go off….
1:30 P.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Margaret Narwin
PHILIP MALLOY: Miss Narwin?
MISS NARWIN: Philip? What are you doing here? What do you want?
PHILIP MALLOY: My class.
MISS NARWIN: You’re … you’re not in this section anymore. You were switched.
PHILIP MALLOY: I was?
MISS NARWIN: You’re in Mr. Keegan’s class.
PHILIP MALLOY: But—
MISS NARWIN: What?
PHILIP MALLOY: To get my grade up—I was going to ask for extra work….
MISS NARWIN: Philip, you are no longer in my class. Didn’t you hear me?
PHILIP MALLOY: So I could get on the track team and …
MISS NARWIN: You are not in my class.
PHILIP MALLOY: But what about the grade?
MISS NARWIN: Please leave the room. I want you out. Sara, take this note to Dr. Doane….
PHILIP MALLOY: But …
MISS NARWIN: You must leave. Go!
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m leaving.
MISS NARWIN: Speak to Dr. Doane. Now, please, leave!
2:50 P.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Coach Jamison
COACH JAMISON: Oh, Philip. Didn’t see you there.
PHILIP MALLOY: Can I talk to you a minute?
COACH JAMISON: Yeah. Sure. Got a minute.
PHILIP MALLOY: Remember, you said I should ask Miss Narwin for some extra work….
COACH JAMISON: Sure.
PHILIP MALLOY: So I could get my grade up, get on the team.
COACH JAMISON: Okay.
PHILIP MALLOY: She won’t let me.
COACH JAMISON: She won’t let you what?
PHILIP MALLOY: Do more work.
COACH JAMISON: Well, look, you did one hell of a number on her….
PHILIP MALLOY: I mean, I’m not even in her class anymore. She must have kicked me out.
COACH JAMISON: They put you in another class?
PHILIP MALLOY: Yeah, but I was trying to get some extra work…. If I could stay in her class I—
COACH JAMISON: Philip, you want my advice?
PHILIP MALLOY: I tried—
COACH JAMISON: I’m always telling you guys—it’s what sports is all about—a rule is a rule—to get along you have
to play along. Know what I’m saying?
PHILIP MALLOY: What about my running with the team?
COACH JAMISON: Look, Philip, you did a number on Miss Narwin. Didn’t I tell you—right from the start—you were
way off base? She’s a good person. You have to be a team player. Haven’t you heard me say that? So you can’t
just come around now and start asking me for things. It just doesn’t work that way. Look, Phil, I’ve got a
practice. And look, by next year this’ll all be over. I sure hope so.
3:30 P.M.
Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Dr. Gertrude Doane
DR. DOANE: Would you like a cup of coffee?
MISS NARWIN: My nerves are too tight as it is.
DR. DOANE: It’s astonishing…. Did I tell you, I had another call from a TV reporter—
MISS NARWIN: No. Absolutely not.
DR. DOANE: I don’t blame you.
MISS NARWIN: You wanted to see me….
DR. DOANE:Just that some good has come out of all this….
MISS NARWIN: That would be nice. What is it?
DR. DOANE: Peg, do you remember you put in an application for funds? Some kind of refresher course, English
teaching. I’m not sure what. For the summer.
MISS NARWIN: Vaguely.
DR. DOANE: I talked to Al Seymour and—
MISS NARWIN: Don’t mention him to me. That statement—
DR. DOANE: As a way of showing his support, he managed to find some money, and you can take that special
course….
MISS NARWIN: Well, that is nice.
DR. DOANE: We’ll expedite the application.
MISS NARWIN: I’m very grateful.
DR. DOANE: There is only one thing….
MISS NARWIN: The deadline?
DR. DOANE: No, it’s not that. Peg, knowing how upsetting this all is, the superintendent wants you to take the rest of
the term off.
MISS NARWIN: What?
DR. DOANE: The rest of the term.
MISS NARWIN: But …
DR. DOANE: Well, Al knows, because I told him, how upsetting all this is to you, and … Take the time off, full pay,
of course, and then, take that course, and you’ll come back fall term … and, well, things will be fine. It’s very
kind of him.
MISS NARWIN: In other words, he wants me to leave.
DR. DOANE: No. No. You’ve misunderstood. Truly, Peg. Only as a way of getting out from the pressure. I mean, all
these telegrams. Calls. It would be administrative leave. You’ll lose no time on your pension. As I said, fulltime. With pay. You could be with your sister…. A sabbatical. You’ve never had one.
MISS NARWIN: No.
DR. DOANE: Peg, you have to see it from his, our side….
MISS NARWIN: Aren’t we on the same side?
DR. DOANE: That’s not the point.
MISS NARWIN: What is the point?
DR. DOANE: Peg, Al is deeply worried about our budget.
6:30 P.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MR. MALLOY: Hey, where’s Philip?
MRS. MALLOY: Up in his room.
MR. MALLOY: These telegrams. Incredible.
MRS. MALLOY: He’s very upset.
MR. MALLOY: About the telegrams?
MRS. MALLOY: Something at school.
MR. MALLOY: That teacher again?
MRS. MALLOY: He wouldn’t say. When he came home, I don’t think he even looked at that stack. He doesn’t seem
very happy. He wouldn’t talk about it.
MR. MALLOY: Weird.
MRS. MALLOY: I almost thought he was going to start crying.
MR. MALLOY: Crying?
MRS. MALLOY: Maybe you could talk to him.
MR. MALLOY: Sure.
MRS. MALLOY: Dinner will be ready in twenty minutes.
MR. MALLOY: I’ll talk to him.
MRS. MALLOY: Hon!
MR. MALLOY: What?
MRS. MALLOY: My sister called.
MR. MALLOY: From Conover?
MRS. MALLOY: She said Philip could go to school in their district.
MR. MALLOY: That’s absurd!
MRS. MALLOY: Maybe it isn’t. Maybe this is too much.
MR. MALLOY: Susan …
MRS. MALLOY:Just a thought.
6:45 P.M.
Phone Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Her Sister, Anita Wigham
ANITA WIGHAM: Peg, I am shocked!
MISS NARWIN: Well, you can imagine how I felt. The dishonesty of it! And from Gertrude of all people. I still find it
impossible to believe.
ANITA WIGHAM: But what are you going to do?
MISS NARWIN: Anita, I don’t know. I truly don’t know.
6:50 P.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and His Father
MR. MALLOY: Philip, I want you to open the door so we can talk.
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t want to talk.
MR. MALLOY: What happened in school?
PHILIP MALLOY: Nothing.
MR. MALLOY: Look, dinner will be ready in five minutes.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m not hungry.
MR. MALLOY: Then what are you going to do?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know.
8:30 P.M.
From a Speech Delivered by Ted Griffen to a Meeting of the Harrison Downtown Association
MR. GRIFFEN: That I can be a forceful, productive member of the board is clear. It was I who made public this sad
story regarding a boy who was removed from class merely because of his desire to express his patriotism.
Even though I am not yet a member of the board, I was able to meet with Superintendent Seymour—who has, I
assure you, my deepest respect—and discuss in a calm, rational fashion what might be done. When it became
clear that the problem was not with school policy itself, but the misguided judgment of a particular teacher—a
teacher out of touch with Harrison values—a solution was worked out that is equitable to all—and preserves
the good name of our community. The boy is back in class, where he belongs and wants to be. The teacher in
question will get a needed refresher course in our values and return to her duties next year better able to teach.
Our community will support just these kinds of productive compromises. And therefore I urge all of you,
on April fifth, to support the school budget proposal set before the voters. It is a thoughtful budget. Let me
make this perfectly clear. The budget is fiscally prudent, and I, for one, support it.
8:50 P.M.
From the Diary of Philip Malloy
Things stink. And it’s all so unfair. Nobody takes my side. They all think Narwin’s great. Nobody pays any
attention to what she did to me. Coach Jamison won’t let me on the team.
I hate that school.
9:30 P.M.
Phone Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Robert Duval, Reporter
MISS NARWIN: I really don’t wish to talk about it.
MR. DUVAL: Ma’am, Miss Narwin, it seems to me, from what I’ve come to understand about you and what
happened, that the original story does not make a great deal of sense. For instance, at one point, Dr. Doane—
your principal—told me you were one of the district’s best teachers.
MISS NARWIN: Did she?
MR. DUVAL: Yes, ma’am. She did.
MISS NARWIN: I’m not so sure she would still say so.
MR. DUVAL: What do you mean?
MISS NARWIN: Mr. Duval … I …
MR. DUVAL: Miss Narwin, I am truly interested in getting out your story. It’s been awfully one-sided.
MISS NARWIN: That’s certainly true. People seem to believe that this boy is … rather special. Nobody seems to
want to pay any attention to what actually happened. I’ve been asked to resign.
MR. DUVAL: By whom?
MISS NARWIN: The school. The district.
MR. DUVAL: Miss Narwin, I’m prepared to fly out and talk to you. I really do think there is something important
here. I’d like to get it out to the public. Miss Narwin?
MISS NARWIN: Very well. Come along. I’ll talk to you.
7:20 a.m.
Phone Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Dr. Gertrude Doane
DR. DOANE: Yes, Peg?
MISS NARWIN: I won’t be coming in today.
DR. DOANE: Oh.
MISS NARWIN: I’m too exhausted.
DR. DOANE: I think that’s wise.
MISS NARWIN: I need time to think.
DR. DOANE: You do that. No problem here. We’ll get a substitute.
7:30 A.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and His Parents at Breakfast
PHILIP MALLOY: No way I’m going to school.
MR. MALLOY: Why?
PHILIP MALLOY: I just won’t.
MRS. MALLOY: Philip, you must tell us. Has that teacher done something else?
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m not in her classes anymore.
MR. MALLOY: But … Look at all these telegrams. Everybody says you did the right thing.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m not going.
MR. MALLOY: Philip, you must go.
PHILIP MALLOY: I’ll go to another school. You said there was a private school.
MRS. MALLOY: But …
MR. MALLOY: Oh, sure! Go to private school! The only money we’ve got is the money we’ve been putting aside for
your college.
PHILIP MALLOY: I could go up to Aunt Becky’s. We could move.
MR. MALLOY: That’s ridiculous. Look, it’s clear something has happened. If we don’t know, how can we help you?
PHILIP MALLOY: The kids hate me!
MR. MALLOY: Why?
PHILIP MALLOY: I’m not going.
MR. MALLOY: Philip, you will go!
7:40 A.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy and Ken Barchet on the Way to the School Bus
PHILIP MALLOY: What’s happening?
KEN BARCHET: Nothing. What’s with you? I thought maybe you weren’t going to school.
PHILIP MALLOY: My folks …
KEN BARCHET: Did you hear what Allison and Todd were planning to do?
PHILIP MALLOY: No, what?
KEN BARCHET: They want to get a petition going to get you to say you were wrong.
PHILIP MALLOY: No way.
KEN BARCHET: And you know who gave them the idea?
PHILIP MALLOY: No.
KEN BARCHET: Coach Jamison.
PHILIP MALLOY: You kidding?
KEN BARCHET: That’s what Brian told me. Want me to start another petition to get Narwin to apologize? Or we
could get you to sing together. Be boss.
PHILIP MALLOY: Would you stop bugging me!
KEN BARCHET: Hey, man, can’t you take a joke?
PHILIP MALLOY: Forget it!
KEN BARCHET: Hey! Come on, Phil. Where you going? I was just kidding!
8:55 A.M.
Phone Conversation between Philip Malloy and His Mother
PHILIP MALLOY:Just want you to know I’m home.
MRS. MALLOY: Home? Why?
PHILIP MALLOY: I told you: I’m not going to school. Not that school.
MRS. MALLOY: Well … stay home today. That’s okay. We’ll talk it out when I get home.
PHILIP MALLOY:Just don’t tell Dad, will you?
MRS. MALLOY: Okay.
10:55 P.M.
Conversation between Philip Malloy’s Parents
MRS. MALLOY: Ben, but he refuses to go back!
MR. MALLOY: I’ve never heard of anything so crazy. He won! But he acts as if he’s lost.
MRS. MALLOY: He says he’ll just wait till we’re out of the house and then come home.
MR. MALLOY: Of all …
MRS. MALLOY: He has to go to some school.
MR. MALLOY: Right …
MRS. MALLOY: I’m going to call Washington Academy.
MR. MALLOY: That’s his college money!
MRS. MALLOY: Or should I call my sister?
12:30 P.M.
Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Robert Duval, Reporter
MR. DUVAL: Miss Narwin, how do you see what has happened? A summary.
MISS NARWIN: I think and I think. And—that boy—Philip Malloy—for reasons I’ll never learn—decided to insult
me, his classmates, and, as far as that goes, the national anthem. Yes, I sent him from my room. But it wasn’t I
who sent him home. I objected to that. Objected strongly. Yet I’ve been blamed for his suspension. It’s I who
has been asked to resign.
MR. DUVAL: Resign?
MISS NARWIN: They say it’s a leave. But Mr. Duval, I’m not stupid. Naïve perhaps. But not stupid. I should be in
school right this moment, teaching my students. Teaching them the literature that I love. That they desperately
need. Who else will give it to them? But where am I? I’m home—surrounded by letters, and telegrams too—
from people, perfect strangers who know nothing about me, who hate me. The post office brought a sack of
letters this morning. That’s why I’m talking to you. I’m trying to defend myself.
Mr. Duval, as I see it, I have been working—working hard—as a teacher for twenty-one years. I’ve been a
good teacher. Ask my principal if that’s not so. Do you know, she was once my student.
MR. DUVAL: Is that right?
MISS NARWIN: Oh, yes. One of the brightest. But did anyone—anyone outside—ever stop and notice those years of
good teaching—did they write a story about that? No. That’s not what people are interested in. Do you know
—I feel like I’ve been mugged. Assaulted.
MR. DUVAL: By whom?
MISS NARWIN: I wish I knew.
MR. DUVAL: Ma’am, do you think there’s some reason that this has happened?
MISS NARWIN: Reason? Mr. Duval, I keep wishing there was a reason. No, no reason at all.
MR. DUVAL: Do you have any idea what you will do about it?
MISS NARWIN: I told you, I’m thinking of resigning.

Conversation between Margaret Narwin and Robert Duval, Reporter
MISS NARWIN: Mr. Duval?
MR. DUVAL: Speaking.
MISS NARWIN: This is Margaret Narwin, from Harrison.
MR. DUVAL: Oh, yes, Miss Narwin. How are you, ma’am?
MISS NARWIN: I’m fine. I wanted to ask you if you published that story—that story that you interviewed me for.
MR. DUVAL: Oh, right. Well, I certainly wrote it. And it has been filed. It was a pretty good story. All set to go too.
But then South America … that situation … There’s no room.
MISS NARWIN: Then you won’t print it?
MR. DUVAL: Well, it’s possible. But I’d be less than candid with you if I said it will appear. With so much
happening …
MISS NARWIN: I see.
MR. DUVAL: I am sorry. I’m sure you would have liked to see it in print….
MISS NARWIN: Yes….
MR. DUVAL: Did you decide what to do, ma’am?
MISS NARWIN: I’m … I’m calling from the airport now. I’m going to Florida. To be with my sister. And her
husband.
MR. DUVAL: You’ve resigned, then.
MISS NARWIN: I need some time to think….
MR. DUVAL: Yes, I understand. And I—excuse me, I’m being called….

Conversation between Philip Malloy and George Brookover, Principal of Washington Academy
GEORGE BROOKOVER: Philip, I just want to tell you that we’re very pleased to have you at Washington Academy.
We do know a good bit about you. You’re pretty famous.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yes, sir.
GEORGE BROOKOVER: We like what we hear. Anyway, we’re all pretty much a family at Washington. I’m sure
you’ll make new friends.
PHILIP MALLOY: Yes, sir.
GEORGE BROOKOVER: You’ll be in Miss Rooney’s class. You’ll find her a good teacher. I’m sure you’ll do just fine.
Have you any interest in sports?
PHILIP MALLOY: Track.
GEORGE BROOKOVER: Well, we don’t have a track team here at Washington. There’s never been enough interest. But
now that you’re here, maybe there can be. Your dad says you’re a crackerjack runner. We do have soccer. You
could do a lot of running there. Think that might interest you?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know.
GEORGE BROOKOVER: Okay. Let me take you on down to class now. Should be just getting under way.
8:30 A.M.
Discussion in Miss Rooney’s Homeroom Class, Washington Academy
MISS ROONEY: Class, this is Philip Malloy, who has just joined our school. Philip, you can sit right over there. We
were about to begin. In fact, we usually begin by singing the national anthem. Maybe you’d like to lead us in
that? Philip? Philip, what’s the matter? Why are you crying?
PHILIP MALLOY: I don’t know the words.

About the Author
Avi was born in 1937 into a family of writers extending as far back as the nineteenth century. He was raised in
New York City. His twin sister, now also a writer, gave him the name Avi because she was either unable or
unwilling to use the name his parents had given him.
When Avi was young, his teachers often told him that his writing didn’t make much sense. He later found out he
had symptoms of dyslexia, a frustrating problem that makes writing difficult. But Avi didn’t give up. He kept trying
to be a writer.
He began his career by writing plays while working as a librarian. When the first of his children was born, he
started to write for young people. His first book, Things That Sometimes Happen: Very Short Stories for Little
Listeners, was published in 1970. Since then, he has authored seventy books. Among the most popular are
Crispin: The Cross of Lead, The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle, Nothing But the Truth, the Poppy books,
Midnight Magic, and The Fighting Ground. His books span nearly every genre and have received almost every
major prize, including the 2003 Newbery Medal for Crispin: The Cross of Lead, two Newbery Honors, two
Boston Globe-Horn Book Awards, and the Scott O’Dell Award for Historical Fiction. Avi has also won many
children’s choice awards, and he frequently travels to schools around the country to talk to his readers.
Additionally, he is the cofounder of ART, the Authors Readers Theatre, a group of writers who perform theatrical
adaptations of their books throughout the country.
Avi lives in Denver, Colorado, with his wife and family. Visit him online at www.avi-writer.com.
Q&A with Avi
Q: How did you become a writer? When did you know that’s what you wanted to be?
A: I made up my mind to be a writer when I was in high school, at the age of seventeen. I became a writer by, one,
reading a great deal, and two, by writing. I don’t think there is any other way.
Q: How old were you when you wrote your first piece of fiction?
A: There is a family tradition that when I was about five I wrote (or more likely dictated) a story called The Cat
was a Very Explorer.
Q: What is your writing process like?
A: I work on a computer in my own small, cluttered office. I work every day, writing and endlessly rewriting.
Q: Do you perform a lot of research before you start writing a story, or do you just dive right in?
A: It differs according to the kind of story I write. If it’s historical fiction that depends on the facts, I need to know
them. If it’s a fantasy, I have to invent the facts.
Q: When you sit down to write a novel, do you know how it’s going to end before you start, or does the writing
process reveal an ending you may not have seen coming?
A: I never know what the ending will be. It emerges out of the many, many rewrites.
Q: Which is the most challenging novel you ever wrote?
A: It’s always the next one.
Q: What do you like to do when you’re not writing?
A: I am a reader, a cook, a runner, and someone who enjoys the outdoors.
Q: What were you like as a child?
A: I was a fairly ordinary kid, fascinated by machines, book and radio stories, and was not given much
opportunity to be engaged in sports.
Q: Which writers, if any, were you influenced by growing up?
A: Thornton W. Burgess, Robert Louis Stevenson (Treasure Island ), Kenneth Grahame (The Wind in the
Willows), and the many writers who wrote “boy books” (The Hardy Boys, Tom Swift, etc.).
Q: Have you noticed a change in the way the media covers stories from when you were Philip Malloy’s age?
A: When I was Philip’s age the media was essentially only newspapers. There was a greater willingness to try for
objectivity.
Q: How have expressions of patriotism changed during your lifetime?
A: I think true patriotism is quiet pride. False patriotism is bully bragging. Over the years that hasn’t changed.
Q: What is your advice to young readers on how to recognize the truth when there are many perspectives from
which to consider important events or issues?
A: Try to follow the Greek philosopher Plato’s advice: Base your beliefs on your own experience, rather than on
what you are simply told or taught.
“The Star-Spangled Banner”
Many people are not aware that there’s more to “The Star-Spangled Banner” than what is sung at the beginning of
baseball games. Written by Francis Scott Key after he witnessed the British attack on Fort McHenry in Maryland
during the War of 1812, it gained in popularity for many years, becoming the official song of the Army and Navy
in the 1890s. But it wasn’t until 1931 that an act of Congress made “The Star-Spangled Banner” the official
national anthem of the United States of America. Take a look at the complete lyrics below!
“The Star-Spangled Banner,” 1814
Words by Francis Scott Key, Music by John Stafford Smith
Oh, say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light,
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming,
Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight,
O’er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?
And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air,
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.
Oh, say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?
On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep,
Where the foe’s haughty host in dread silence reposes,
What is that which the breeze, o’er the towering steep,
As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
Now it catches the gleam of the morning’s first beam,
In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream.
’Tis the star-spangled banner; oh, long may it wave
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle’s confusion
A home and a country should leave us no more?
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps’ pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave
From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!
Oh! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand
Between their loved homes and the war’s desolation!
Blest with victory and peace, may the heaven-rescued land
Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
Then conquer we must, for our cause it is just,
And this be our motto: “In God is our trust!”
And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave,
O’er the land of the free, and the home of the brave!

2. Satire is not considered a protected form of free speech.
3. In 1644, poet John Milton wrote one of the earliest defenses in the Western world of freedom of speech in an
essay titled Areopagitica.

Three Sides of the Same Coin
You’ve heard of the phrase “There are two sides to every story.” But what happens when there are more? In
Nothing But the Truth, Avi explores one event from multiple viewpoints. Each person has a different perception
of what happened in Miss Narwin’s classroom. Who was telling the truth? Who was lying? Can the truth ever
really be determined when different people see the same event in different ways?
Now it’s your turn to explore the nature of truth by creating your own short story that examines one event from
various perspectives. Here are some suggestions and questions to get you started!
Character
Briefly develop a main character and supporting characters. What do they look like? How old are they? Where do
they live? Who do they live with? What are their interests? What do they do for a living? Ask yourself as many
questions as possible about each character and create a kind of dossier.
Motivation
What motivates the characters in your story to tell their version of the core event? What reasons might they have
for being honest, bending the truth, telling only the partial truth, or completely lying? What about each of the
witnesses might affect his or her recollection of the event?
Point of View
Though stories can be told from various points of view (first person, third person, omniscient), for the purposes of
this exercise, let’s use shifting points of view. That will allow you to enter the mind of each of your characters and
show the event from their perspectives.
Catalyst Event
This is the action or event that will set your story in motion. Choose something that your main character and
supporting characters will experience or witness (or claim they’ve witnessed). The event could be a crime, an act
of kindness, or anything else that has dramatic impact. Only you, as the writer, will know the truth of what
happened, even if none of the characters in your story ever reveals it.
Plot
The plot includes the specific chain of events that the author uses to build a story. It’s planned, logical, and gives
the story a beginning (introducing the characters and setting), middle (where events become complicated and the
conflict is revealed), and end (featuring a climax that includes a resolution of the conflict).
Conflict
Conflict is essential to the drama and in forming the plot. It can be thought of as a problem that the main characters
have to work toward resolving. Conflict is certainly not limited to characters arguing with each other, though that
could be one aspect of the story. In a broader sense, the conflict is some kind of obstacle the main character or
characters experience which they must overcome as part of the resolution of the story.
Theme
This is what your story is really about. It can be thought of as the controlling idea, or message, of the story,
conveying meaning and insight about the subject chosen by the writer. For the purpose of this exercise, stick to the
theme of truth using Avi’s story as your inspiration.
Setting
Where will your story take place? You may also want to consider the time of year, social conditions, and the
overall mood and atmosphere of the setting. Try to think of ways that the setting is important to the story. In what
ways does it contribute to character perceptions of the catalyst event?
Now that you have the basic elements of the story, you’re ready to begin writing! The story can be as long or as
short as you want it to be, and should resolve in a satisfying way, even if readers don’t ultimately discover the real
“truth” of what happened and must draw their own conclusions about what took place.
As the story develops, try to figure out your own ideas about the nature of truth. What is the relationship
between facts and truth? Do separate facts, even if they’re all true, combine to present a complete picture of
things? Can you think of any ways in which knowing all the facts would still not be adequate for understanding the
truth about something? How can you incorporate some of these ideas into your narrative?
Remember to keep an open mind and a ready pen. Don’t be too concerned with knowing every little detail about
the event, the characters, and the character motivations before you start to write. Much of the fun in writing is
discovering things as you go!
A Sneak Peek at Something Upstairs
Avi spins a chilling tale of ghostly revenge in this spooky story about a young boy who discovers a haunted
spirit in the closet of his bedroom. Take a look!
A white glow, almost shiny, and brightest on the floor, filled the windowless space. And what Kenny saw — or
thought he saw — were two hands, then two arms, reaching up from the stain, pushing away a box of his mother’s
old books that was sitting on it. These hands and arms seemed to be not flesh and blood but sculptured, glowing
smoke. It was as if, from under that box, a body was struggling to be free.
Astonished, Kenny stood staring, telling himself that what he was seeing was not real. A dream perhaps. Some
kind of fancy. But no, not real.
Bit by bit, the arms edged the box off the stain. It seemed like hard work. Their muscles bulged with effort.
Sometimes, as if tired, the arms would seem to rest. Then the hands with their small but perfect fingers would curl
around the box’s edge flexing out apparent pain.
It took an hour for the carton to be pushed away. Kenny watched it all. When the job was done the hands
reached from the floor, held onto the box, and … pulled.
A head rose from the stain. Then came a neck. Then shoulders. The rest of the body. Soon the whole thing stood
upon the floor — still and waiting. A soft, pale, pulsing glow radiated from its body, a glow which formed a
vague boundary between air and mass, in equal parts nothing and something.
Except it was clearly not a thing. It was a shape like a human being.
The figure had no shoes. But Kenny recollects seeing trousers and a shirt, not tucked in, whose frayed sleeves
reached midway between elbows and wrists. A stain was spread upon the back of the shirt.
The more Kenny looked, the more certain he was that this was a boy.
As Kenny watched, the boy approached the far wall, where he began to feel about its surface, as if he were in
search of something, as if he were looking for a way out.
He tried the second wall. The third.
Kenny fumbled for the flashlight switch and turned it on, aiming it right at the form. The light went through him.
He cast no shadow.
Just then Kenny saw, with a mixture of thrill and horror, that the boy was about to move toward the door wall.
They would come face to face.
The figure turned. Their eyes met. Unexpectedly, the boy’s hand reached toward Kenny. Taken completely off
guard, Kenny reacted defensively, lifting his shoe to protect himself. The boy shrank back as if expecting a blow.
And the next second he vanished, leaving Kenny to stare into the empty room.
It was as if the boy feared him.
